Modern apps rely heavily on third-party APIs (think payment processors, data providers, etc.), but once TLS kicks in, figuring out exactly what data is being sent, identifying PII exposure, or debugging integration issues becomes incredibly difficult without resorting to complex and often brittle solutions.<p>Traditional approaches like forward proxies require terminating TLS (MITM), managing certificates, and often introduce performance bottlenecks or single points of failure. Network firewalls usually operate at L3&#x2F;L4 and lack payload visibility. We felt there had to be a better way.<p>That&#x27;s why we built qtap. It&#x27;s a lightweight agent that uses eBPF to tap into network traffic at the kernel level. The key idea is to hook into common TLS libraries (like OpenSSL) before encryption and after decryption. This gives us deep visibility into the actual request&#x2F;response payloads of HTTPS&#x2F;TLS traffic without needing to terminate the connection or manage certs. Because it leverages eBPF, the performance impact is minimal compared to traditional methods.<p>With qtap, we can now see exactly which external services our apps are talking to, inspect the payloads for debugging or security auditing (e.g., spotting accidental PII leaks), monitor API performance&#x2F;errors for third-party dependencies, and get a much clearer picture of our egress traffic patterns.<p>We&#x27;ve found this approach really powerful for improving reliability and security posture. We&#x27;ve packaged qtap as a Linux Binary, Docker container, and Helm chart for deployment.<p>This is still evolving, but we&#x27;re excited about the potential of using eBPF for this kind of deep, yet non-intrusive, visibility.<p>We&#x27;d love to get the HN community&#x27;s feedback:<p><pre><code>    Do you face similar challenges monitoring encrypted egress traffic?\n    What are your thoughts on using eBPF for this compared to other methods?\n    Any suggestions or potential use cases we haven&#x27;t considered?\n</code></pre>\nHappy to answer any questions!",

A few things we&#x27;ve built that aren&#x27;t supported as an extension:\n- the Accept|Reject UI and UX\n- Cmd+K\n- Control over the terminal and tabs\n- Custom autocomplete\n- Smaller things like ability to open&#x2F;close the sidebar, onboarding, etc<p>It&#x27;s been a lot harder to build an IDE than an extension, but we think having full control over the IDE (whether that&#x27;s VSCode or something else we build in the future) will be important in the long run, especially when the next iteration of tool-use LLMs comes out (having native control over Git, the UI&#x2F;UX around switching between iterations, etc).",

It is also why the opcodes seem strewn around the instructions space arbitrarily, sometimes in obvious groups and sometimes apparently spread widely. And why it is risky to use them: if a later revision of the CPU adds any new instructions, the accidentally useful opcodes could become something quite² different as the designers only need to make sure the official ones keep functioning as they did before.<p>--------<p>[1] There usually isn&#x27;t a straight table of “this code means do that to that with this and store there” — that would take more silicon, and likely be notably slower, than the pass-the-bits-through-a-bunch-of-logic-gates approach.<p>[2] Or, perhaps worse, <i>subtly</i> different!",

Most of the functionality of the 32-bit ARM instruction set is available, but some operations require more instructions. The Thumb instruction set provides better code density, at the expense of performance.<p>&gt; ARMv6T2 introduces Thumb-2 technology. This is a major enhancement to the Thumb instruction set by providing 32-bit Thumb instructions. The 32-bit and 16-bit Thumb instructions together provide almost exactly the same functionality as the ARM instruction set. This version of the Thumb instruction set achieves the high performance of ARM code along with the benefits of better code density.<p>So, in summary:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.arm.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;ddi0210&#x2F;c&#x2F;CACBCAAE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.arm.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;ddi0210&#x2F;c&#x2F;CACBCAAE</a><p>&gt; The Thumb instruction set is a subset of the most commonly used 32-bit ARM instructions. Thumb instructions are each 16 bits long, and have a corresponding 32-bit ARM instruction that has the same effect on the processor model. Thumb instructions operate with the standard ARM register configuration, allowing excellent interoperability between ARM and Thumb states.<p>&gt; On execution, 16-bit Thumb instructions are transparently decompressed to full 32-bit ARM instructions in real time, without performance loss.<p>For an example of how loadable microcode worked in practice, look up the Three Rivers PERQ:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;PERQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;PERQ</a><p>&gt; The name &quot;PERQ&quot; was chosen both as an acronym of &quot;Pascal Engine that Runs Quicker,&quot; and to evoke the word perquisite commonly called a perk, that is an additional employee benefit",

Decoding performance might also be relevant.<p>The result of these thoughts is something I called &quot;PISC&quot;, programmable instruction set computer, which basically means an unchanged back-end (something like RISC + vector) but a programmable decoder in front of it. So then different pieces of code could use different encodings, optimized for each case.<p>...which you get in RISC with subroutines + instruction cache, if you regard the CALL instructions as &quot;encoded custom instructions&quot;, but not quite because CALLs waste a lot of bits, and you need additional instructions to pass arguments.<p>For pure RISC, all of this would at best take some pressure of the instruction cache, so probably not worth it.

It knows this because it knows where it isn&#x27;t. By subtracting where it is from where it isn&#x27;t, or where it isn&#x27;t from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn&#x27;t, and arriving at a position where it wasn&#x27;t, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn&#x27;t, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn&#x27;t.<p>In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn&#x27;t, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn&#x27;t. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was.\nThe missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn&#x27;t, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn&#x27;t, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn&#x27;t be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.<p>-----------",

We used to have an interview question around sampling from a weighted distribution (typical answer: prefix sum -&gt; binary search) and I don’t think anyone produced this. I like the explanation in that blog. The way it was explained to me was first ‘imagine drawing a bar chart and throwing a dart at it, retrying if you miss. This simulates the distribution but runs in expected linear time’. Then you can describe how to chop up the bars to fit in the rectangle you would get if all weights were equal. Proof that the greedy algorithm works is reasonably straightforward.",

              "text": "Very nice post!<p>Another interesting direction you can take reservoir sampling is instead of drawing a random number for each item (to see whether it replaces an existing item and which one), you generate a number from a geometric distribution telling you how many items you can safely skip before the next replacement.<p>That&#x27;s especially interesting, if you can skip many items cheaply.  Eg because you can fast forward on your tape drive (but you don&#x27;t know up front how long your tape is), or because you send almost your whole system to sleep during skips.<p>For n items to sample from, this system does about O(k * log (n&#x2F;k)) samples and skips.<p>Conceptually, I prefer the version of reservoir sampling that has you generate a fixed random &#x27;priority&#x27; for each card as it arrives, and then you keep the top k items by priority around.  That brings me to another related interesting algorithmic problem: selecting the top k items out of a stream of elements of unknown length in O(n) time and O(k) space.  Naive approaches to reaching O(k) space will give you O(n log k) time, eg if you keep a min heap around.<p>What you can do instead is keep an unordered buffer of capacity up to 2<i>k.  As each item arrives, you add it to the buffer.  When your buffer is full, you prune it to the top k element in O(k) with eg randomised quickselect or via median-of-medians.  You do that O(2</i>k) work every k elements for n elements total, given you the required O(n) = O(n * 2*k &#x2F; k) runtime.<p>Another related topic is rendezvous hashing: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rendezvous_hashing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rendezvous_hashing</a><p>Tangentially related: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keithschwarz.com&#x2F;darts-dice-coins&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keithschwarz.com&#x2F;darts-dice-coins&#x2F;</a> is a great write-up on the alias method for sampling from a discrete random distribution.",

There are (at least) two ways:<p>You can do an alternative interpretation and implementation of reservoir sampling: for each item you generate and store a random priority as it comes into the system.  For each interval (eg each second) you keep the top k items by priority.  If you want to aggregate multiple intervals, you keep the top k (or less) items over the intervals.<p>This will automatically deal with dealing all items the same, whether they arrived during busy or non-busy periods.<p>An alternative view of the same approach doesn&#x27;t store any priorities, but stores the number of dropped items each interval.  You can then do some arithmetic to tell you how to combine samples from different intervals; very similar to what&#x27;s in the article.<p>&gt; What are the use-cases that reservoir sampling are good for? What kind of statistical analysis can you do on the data that&#x27;s returned by it?<p>Anything you can do on any unbiased sample?

The web-app GUI in the demo is less than perfect, but kinda ok, if you enable chapter-view. The biggest problem is a single set of ±10 s rewind buttons: for a dedicated audio-book player it&#x27;s not enough, a separate ±1 min button set is a must. But since the authors didn&#x27;t think of that, I don&#x27;t expect it to be different in the Android app. I&#x27;m rather asking about mobile-specific features:<p>1. Does it properly stop the playback when headphones are disconnected?<p>2. Is there a usable lock-screen widget?<p>3. Does it auto-rewind after a pause? It&#x27;s best when the pause duration is taken into account: it shouldn&#x27;t rewind more than a couple of seconds if you pause for a second, but a whole minute may be better if you left it off yesterday.<p>4. Does it handle well situations when the server is not accessible? Can you just pre-download a couple of audio-books for your 10 h long flight? I mean, honestly, streaming is never desirable, the only point of a self-hosted server is that you don&#x27;t have to download and delete your collection manually. It&#x27;s a tricky problem when the playlist is highly variable (as with music), but for an audio-book player should be a non issue: just pre-fetch a whole book (maybe manually), storage space is a lesser issue than mobile internet.",

You can basically go through every item one-by-one, or you can run an automatic script to check the whole collection. It would be great if you could define certain rules to require manual review, and incrementally run the tool to improve the tags whenever you have a bit of free time to clean up your collection.<p>But the ideal solution would be to have some way of generating fingerprints for each audiobook, and then build up a database which matches that fingerprint to the correct metadata. That way the work of organizing and tagging large collections could be crowdsourced; this is what other communities have done.<p>Maybe we&#x27;re not too far off from AI-assisted tools that can just figure out how to properly tag a bunch of items correctly just by looking at the filename and existing metadata. Maybe even picking up on additional contextual clues by listening to a little bit of a chapter, to check if the title of the work is mentioned at the start.",

              "text": "Just to throw my experience in, it&#x27;s been _wildly_ effective.<p>Example;<p>I&#x27;m wrapping up, right now, an updated fork of the PHP extension `phpredis` because Redis 8 recently was released with support for a new data type, Vector Set but the phpredis extension (which is far more performant that non-extension redis libraries for PHP) doesn&#x27;t support the new vector-related commands. I forked the extension repo, which is in C (I&#x27;m a PHP developer, I had to install CLion for the first time just to work along with CC) and fired up claude code with the initial prompt&#x2F;task of analyzing the extensions code and documenting the purpose, conventions, and anything that it (claude) felt would benefit the bootstrapping process of future sessions such that whole files wouldn&#x27;t need to be read into a CLAUDE.md file.<p>This initially, depending on the size of the codebase, could be &quot;expensive&quot;. Being that this is merely a PHP extension and isn&#x27;t a huge codebase, I was fine letting it just rip through the whole thing however it saw fit - were this a larger codebase I&#x27;d take a more measured approach to this initial &quot;indexing&quot; of the codebase.<p>This results in a file that claude uses like we do a readme.<p>Next I end this session, start a new one and tell it to review that CLAUDE.md file (I specifically tell it to do this, every single new session start moving forward) and then generate a general overview&#x2F;plan of what needs to be done in order to implement the new Vector Set related commands so that I can use this custom phpredis extension in my PHP environments. I indicated that I wanted to generate a suite of tests focused on ensuring each command works with all of it&#x27;s various required and optional parameters and that I wanted to use docker containers for the testing rather than mess up my local dev environment.<p>$22 in API costs and ~6 hours spent and I have the extension, working, in my local environment with support for all of the commands I want&#x2F;need to use. (there&#x27;s still 5 commands that I don&#x27;t intend to use that I haven&#x27;t implemented)<p>Not only would I have certainly never embarked upon trying to extend a C PHP extension, I wouldn&#x27;t have done so over the course of an evening and morning.<p>Another example:<p>Before this redis vector sets thing I used CC to build a python image and text embedding pipeline backed by Redis streams and Celery that consumes tasks pushed to the stream by my Laravel application that currently manages ~120 million unique strings and ~65 million unique images that I&#x27;ve been generating embeddings for. Prior to this I&#x27;d spent very little time with Python and zero with anything related to ML. Now I have a performant python service that&#x27;s portable that I run from my Macbook (M2 Pro) or various GPU-having Windows machines in my home that generate the embeddings on an &#x27;as available&#x27; basis, pushing the results back to a redis stream that my Laravel app then consumes and processes.<p>The results of these embeddings and the similarity-related features that they&#x27;ve brought to the Laravel application are honestly staggering. And while I&#x27;m sure I could have spent months stumbling through all of this on my own - I wouldn&#x27;t have, I don&#x27;t have that much time for side project curiosities.<p>Somewhat related - these similarity features have directly resulted in this side project becoming a service people now pay me to use.<p>On a day to do - the effectiveness is a learned skill. You really need to learn how to work with it in the same way you, as a layperson, wouldn&#x27;t stroll up to a highly specialized piece of aviation technology and just infer how to use it optimally. I hate to keep parroting &quot;skill issue&quot; but - it&#x27;s just wild to me how effective these tools are and how there&#x27;s so many people who don&#x27;t seem to be able to find any use.<p>If it&#x27;s burning through cash, you&#x27;re not being focused enough with it. \nIf it&#x27;s writing code that&#x27;s always slightly wrong, stop it and make adjustments. Those adjustments likely&#x2F;potentially need to be documented in something like I described above in a long-running document used similarly to a prompt.<p>From my own experience, I watch the &quot;&#x2F;settings&#x2F;logs&quot; route on anthropics website while CC is working once I know that we&#x27;re getting rather heavy with the context. Once it gets into the 50-60,000 tokens range I either aim to wrap up whatever the current task is, or I understand that things are going to start getting a little wonky into the 80k+ range. It&#x27;ll keep on working up into the 120-140k tokens or more - but you&#x27;re likely going to end up with lots of &quot;dumb&quot; stuff happening. You really don&#x27;t want to be here unless you&#x27;re _sooooo close_ to getting done what you&#x27;re trying to. When the context gets too high and you need&#x2F;want to reset but you&#x27;re mid task - &#x2F;compact [add notes here about next steps] and it&#x27;ll generate a summary that will then be used to bootstrap the next session. (Don&#x27;t do this more than once, really, as it starts losing a lot of context - just reset the session fully after the first &#x2F;compact)<p>If you&#x27;re constantly running into huge contexts you&#x27;re not being focused enough. If you can&#x27;t even work on anything without reading files with thousands of lines - either break up those files somehow or you&#x27;re going to have to be _really_ specific with the initial prompt and context - which I&#x27;ve done lots of. Say I have a model that belongs to a 10+ year old project that is 6000 lines long and I want to work on a specific method in that model - I&#x27;ll just tell claude in the initial message&#x2F;prompt which line that method starts on, ends on and what number of lines from the start of the model it should read (so it can get the namespace, class name, properties, etc) and then let it do it&#x27;s thing. I&#x27;ll tell it specifically not to read more than 50 lines of that file at a time when looking for something or reviewing something, or even to stop and ask me to locate a method&#x2F;usages of things, etc rather than reading whole files into context.<p>So, again, if it&#x27;s burning through money - focus your efforts. If you think you can just fire it up and give it a generic task - you&#x27;re going to burn money and get either complete junk, or something that might technically work but is hideous, at least to you. But, if you&#x27;re disciplined and try to set or create boundaries and systems that it can adhere to - it does, for the most part.",

The sheer amount of discussion and code creation would have been impossible without AI, and I used the full limits I was afforded.<p>So to answer your question, I got my money&#x27;s worth in that specific use case. That said, the previous failing effort also unearthed a ton of unspoken assumptions that I was able to leverage.  Without providing those assumptions to the AI, I couldn&#x27;t have produced the app they wanted.  Extracting that information was like extracting teeth so I&#x27;m not sure if we would have really had a better situation if we started off with everyone having an OpenAPI Pro account.<p>* Those who work in enterprise know intuitively what happened next.",

In other words an outdated abstraction that&#x27;s still useful so it&#x27;s kept around.<p>An example of this complexity is video streams utilizing hardware accelerated decoding. Those often won&#x27;t show up in screenshots, or if they do they might be out of sync or otherwise not quite what you saw on screen because the driver is attempting to construct a single cohesive snapshot for you where one never actually existed in the first place.<p>If I got anything wrong please let me know.

Confusingly, the traditional paths used &#x2F;dev&#x2F;ptyxx for masters and &#x2F;dev&#x2F;ttyxx for slaves, which is not the same as the tty-vs-pty distinction here.) &quot;VT&quot; or &quot;virtual console&quot; are unambiguous and more commonly used terms than &quot;TTY&quot; in this sense. Serial, Parallel, and USB terminals don&#x27;t really fit into this distinction properly, even though they&#x27;re close to the original definition of teletype they don&#x27;t support VT APIs.<p>There are many things the kernel provides in a real TTY (raw keyboard, beeper control, VCS[A] buffers, etc.). &quot;The&quot; framebuffer at &#x2F;dev&#x2F;fb0 etc. is usually swapped out when the TTY is (assuming proper keyboard&#x2F;event handling, which is really icky), so it counts. Actually it&#x27;s more complicated than &quot;framebuffer&quot; since X11&#x2F;Wayland actually use newer abstractions that the framebuffer is now built on top of (if I understand correctly; I&#x27;ve only dabbled here).<p>Note that there are 3 special devices the kernel provides:<p><pre><code>  &#x2F;dev&#x2F;tty0 is a sort-of alias for whichever &#x2F;dev&#x2F;tty1 etc. is currently active. This is not necessarily the one the program was started on; getting that is very hacky.\n  &#x2F;dev&#x2F;tty is a sort-of alias for the current program&#x27;s controlling terminal (see credentials(7)), which might be a PTY or a TTY or none at all.\n  &#x2F;dev&#x2F;console is where the kernel logs stuff and single-user logins are done, which by default is &#x2F;dev&#x2F;tty0 but you can pass console= multiple times (the last will be used in contexts where a single device is needed).\n</code></pre>\nThis is probably wrong but hopefully informative.",

I mean, more twisted than it already was.<p>Ironically, two people I worked with in the early Apple days -- Steve Jobs, enough already said, and Jef Raskin, who designed the first incarnation of the Macintosh -- both died of pancreatic cancer.<p>I actually miss Jef. We lived together for a while, as I was finishing Apple Writer and my frequent commutes from Oregon were becoming impractical.<p>Here&#x27;s a Jef Raskin story I think almost no one knows. Jet resolved to design an electric car. He packed a bunch of 12 volt car batteries into a relatively small, lightweight car, and, after removing the ICE, rigged an electric motor in its place.<p>First test drive, Jef tried to descend a hill, only to discover the car&#x27;s brakes, which until then had gotten an assist from the ICE, were nowhere near adequate to stop the suddenly-massive battery bank. Very scary, briefly out of control, but no harm done.",

That sucks!”<p>I tried explaining how we’d performed an experiment proving pie menus were faster than linear menus, but he insisted the liner menus in NeXT Step were the best possible menus ever.<p>When I explained to him how flexible NeWS was, he told me &quot;I don&#x27;t need flexibility -- I got my window system right the first time!&quot;<p>But who was I to rain on his parade, two weeks after the first release of NeXT Step 0.8? He just wasn&#x27;t in the mood to be told that he could have a better user interface.<p>So I gave him one of the a &quot;NeRD&quot; buttons I&#x27;d made for NeWS NeRDs, which he appreciated.<p>Up to that time, NeXT was the most hyped piece of vaporware ever, and doubters were wearing t-shirts saying “NeVR Step”!<p>Even after he went back to Apple, Steve Jobs never took a bite of Apple Pie Menus, the forbidden fruit.

              "text": "Wow, what an amazing story. Fascinating from an engineering perspective. Quoting a few of my favorite bits:<p>&gt;Mark began by taking a vertical slice of, say, Chartres and replicating it in a special kind of plastic. He’d then hang fishing weights from various points on the plastic replica, like ornaments on a Christmas tree, to simulate the actual external forces acting upon various parts of the cathedral. There was the direct load of the overhead stone, of course, but also the winds. (To estimate the winds in the 12th century, he found anemometer readings in rural France going back a century. Not perfect, but good enough.) He placed his fully loaded plastic model in an oven, where it was subjected not just to heat but also light. Warmed, the plastic model revealed its stresses, sort of like the way an MRI reveals damage to soft human tissue.<p>&gt;“The very words ‘statistical analysis’ seem foreign to many in rock engineering. Engineers are trained to see the world in terms of load and deformation, where failure is simply a matter of stress exceeding strength. Statistics are generally given short shrift in engineering curriculums, and so the entire language of statistics is unfamiliar. Yet statistics are the tools that science has developed to deal with uncertainty and probability, which are both at the heart of mining ground control.”<p>&gt;Real-life American workers were different from his mental model of them. “I had thought if they only knew what I thought, they’d see things how I do,” he said. That idea now struck him as so obviously nuts that he didn’t bother to let them know what he thought. His fellow coal miners were less concerned with his ideas about the economy and their rightful place in it than in simply making a living. Their morale, at that moment, was actually sky-high. “Coal was booming,” said Chris. “We were going to save the world. Thank god we have all this coal so we’re not reliant on Arab oil. People felt good about themselves.”<p>&gt;“A mine is unlike any man-made structure,” said Chris. “It’s not a designed environment. Most of the material the structure is made from is kind of unknown. With rock you don’t know what the engineering properties are — what the loads are. You have a problem that is really not an engineering problem, but people were insisting on using an engineering mindset to solve it.”<p>&gt;Again, he found work done by others and repurposed it for his uses. Back in the 1940s, geologists working for the Agriculture Department in national forests created a crude method for work crews to determine if some rock would work as a road: whacking it with a ball-peen hammer. Oddly, it didn’t matter how hard you whacked it. There were just a handful of ways the rock might react, and its specific reaction revealed its strength. Chris started whacking mine roofs with ball-peen hammers. “It’s not precise,” he said, “but it does get you in the ballpark.”",

Not by guaranteeing that people can make decisions - silly or not - with any level of guarantee.<p>Maybe a government buyback for property in an area that is rezoned because of climate reasons. Maybe a change in building standards to make rebuilds more reliable in the face of the new normal. Maybe public housing elsewhere to absorb the impact of such events until people can remake their lives and move on. Feel free to insert better ideas.<p>But the change in circumstances - in this case climate activity - <i>has to be handled or it borders on stupidity</i>.",

This helps speeding up certain classes of compute-intense applications like audio&#x2F;video codecs, machine learning, and some cryptography.<p>Bulk memory instructions: A set of new instructions allows faster copying and initialization of regions of memory or ranges of tables.<p>Multi-value results: Instructions, blocks, and functions can now return more than one result value, sometimes supporting faster calling conventions and avoiding indirections. In addition, block instructions now also can have inputs, enabling new program transformations.<p>Reference types: References to functions or pointers to external objects (e.g., JavaScript values) become available as opaque first-class values. Tables are repurposed as a general storage for such reference values, and new instructions allow accessing and mutating tables in Wasm code. In addition, modules now may define multiple tables of different types.<p>Non-trapping conversions: Additional instructions allow the conversion from float to integer types without the risk of trapping unexpectedly.<p>Sign extension instructions: A new group of instructions allows directly extending the width of signed integer value. Previously that was only possible when reading from memory.",

We&#x27;re unlikely to uncover records on the organic media the Phoenician alphabet was tailored for, but Mesopotamian cultures were contemporaries of the Phoenicians and we&#x27;re discovering&#x2F;translating new cuneiform tablets all the time.

I acknowledge that maintaining an isolated identity for the Discord&#x2F;whatever accounts would have limited the scope of the damage, but it’s often not very practical for a variety of reasons, and perhaps more importantly, the anonymity is part of the problem too: the trouble-maker has anonymity, and uses it for bad.<p>Under the Law of Moses, a discovered false witness in court was to receive the punishment he tried to cause, explicitly as a deterrent to dishonesty. Deuteronomy 19:16–21:<p>&gt; <i>If an unrighteous witness rises up against any man to testify against him of wrongdoing, then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges who shall be in those days; and the judges shall make diligent inquisition; and behold, if the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother, then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother. So you shall remove the evil from amongst you. Those who remain shall hear, and fear, and will never again commit any such evil amongst you. Your eyes shall not pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.</i><p>I presume Meta knows who made the report. I wonder if they ever make diligent inquisition, and ban the troll. I doubt it.<p>Imagine if the account-reporting procedure stated a clear policy: “if we find your report vexatious, we will ban <i>your</i> account instead”. Or “if we find your report vexatious, we will tell your target your account details so they can pursue legal action if they desire”.<p>Such harassment and threats as these frequently break laws, but anonymity (and ponderous legal systems, and jurisdiction problems) makes it <i>much</i> harder to pursue in a legal system.<p>Returning to the original case: if there were no anonymity at all, I doubt it would have happened, and remedy might have been easier if it did.<p>I’m not against anonymity, I just feel the total picture is more nuanced than you’re presenting it. Anonymity has both advantages and disadvantages.",

I have no idea how they just go along with it and decide in favor of the reporter with zero evidence. Sure, maybe bans need to be proactive but there should at least be an appeals process.<p>There should probably be more laws that cover permanent bans for business platforms that have a marketshare above a certain size. You shouldn’t be able to be permanently banned from services like this that dominate their respective markets without a robust process. There should probably be cases where even the violation of certain aspects of ToS can’t get you banned permanently, where law overrides ToS.

Despite this, there are frequent &quot;refactorings&quot; which cause breaking changes to APIs. (I&#x27;m tempted to term this &quot;refuckering&quot;.)<p>Some of this API churn is just renaming types or enum values for consistency, or adding new parameters to functions. Some changes are major, such as turning an event loop inside out. Code using the API must be fixed to compensate.<p>Because of all the breaking changes, the related crates (Wgpu, the interface to Vulkan, etc., Winit, the interface to the operating system&#x27;s window manager, and Egui, which handles 2D dialog boxes and menus) must advance in lockstep. There&#x27;s not much coordination between the various development groups on this. Wgpu and Winit both think they&#x27;re in charge. and others should adapt to them. Egui tries to cope. Users of the stack suffer in silence.<p>When there&#x27;s a bug, there&#x27;s no going back to an older version. The refuckering prevents that. Changes due to API breaks are embedded in code that uses these APIs.<p>I&#x27;m currently chasing what ought to be a simple bug in egui, and I&#x27;ve been stuck for over a month.\nThe unit tests won&#x27;t run for some target platforms that used to work, and bug reports are ignored while new\nfeatures are being added. (Users keep demanding more features in Egui, and Egui is growing towards web browser layout complexity.)<p>Most users are giving up. In the last year, three 3D rendering libraries and two major 3D game projects have been abandoned.

The name is confusing (names are hard), the architecture is new (people don&#x27;t want to learn it), and it lends itself to conspiracy theories (that aren&#x27;t true).<p>But it really is a magnificent piece of technology. Because they&#x27;re called &quot;Server Components&quot; people think that &quot;server&quot; means run-time, but as a friend pointed out, 15 years ago people were running wordpress servers and caching pages ahead-of-time. As Dan mentions here: &quot;server&quot; doesn&#x27;t imply it has to execute at run-time.<p>But there are also massive advantages to running a server at run-time that seem lost on people. I do think over time the concepts behind RSCs will filter out into most web frameworks because they are so powerful. It&#x27;s the best functionality of the old-world SSR languages (PHP, rails) combined with the best functionality of the new-world client frameworks (React). You get to pick and choose when to lean on either, and they work together through composition.<p>I wish people were a bit more patient and spent a bit more time trying to understand these concepts before bashing them. Part of that is the fault of names, communication, and lack of documentation. But the underlying technology is rigid and strong. It&#x27;s here to stay, even if it arrives in other forms.",

The distinction is artificial (of course there’s always a server behind the scenes), the question is just which server you’re programming <i>against</i> in the abstraction stack of the majority of your program.

And again that $600 course on how to replicate the experience is on the back of my mind giving me some bad MLM vibes.<p>I understand that there are always groups of people who want a more village-type living arrangement but I don’t know how to evaluate what exactly this is and if it’s beneficial above conventional alternatives.",

                  "text": "Since this is a thread about the new pope, note that Catholic doctrine interprets that passage to mean you can only divorce if the original marriage was invalid. The Greek word, porneia, has more literal or abstract interpretations depending on context. Protestants and Orthodox[1] interpret it to mean illicit sex, particularly adultery, but Catholics interpret it to mean something closer to incest, which would imply a marriage was never valid in the first place. Catholic doctrine argues this interpretation is easier to square with the preceding statements by Jesus in Matthew that &quot;So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.&quot; That is, that marriage is indissoluble by man--i.e. a spouse can&#x27;t dissolve a marriage just be screwing around. And also squares with Mark, who mentions no exception. OTOH, that&#x27;s arguably asking too much of the text.<p>[1] That said, depending on which Orthodox theologian you ask, Orthodoxy doesn&#x27;t permit remarriage, either. Some Orthodox will tell you that a second marriage isn&#x27;t a sacramental marriage; that the original marriage is never dissolved. Rather, &quot;remarriage&quot; is a form of &quot;Ekonomia&quot;, wherein the community sort of ignores some misbehavior, or withholds judgment, so as to avoid cutting a person off entirely. Pope Francis explicitly mentioned this concept of &quot;ekonomia&quot; when discussing his preference that (civilly) remarried Catholics be permitted the Eucharist. And he arguably had this concept in mind when advocating for the blessing of people in same-sex relationships.",

However, Prevost is said to have never authorized that particular situation, the priest was not an Augustinian, and it took place before the Dallas Charter.&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;collegeofcardinalsreport.com&#x2F;cardinals&#x2F;robert-francis-prevost&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;collegeofcardinalsreport.com&#x2F;cardinals&#x2F;robert-franci...</a><p>Edit:<p>There is also this discussion of an incident in Peru:<p>&quot;More recently, questions were raised about Prevost’s knowledge and handling of abuse allegations in his former Diocese of Chiclayo. Two priests were accused of molesting three young girls, with the allegations surfacing in April 2022 during Prevost’s tenure as bishop. The case has been a source of frustration for local Catholics due to its slow progress and unclear resolution.<p>&quot;Some accusers have claimed Prevost failed to properly investigate the allegations and covered up for the accused priest, but the diocese has firmly denied this, stating that Prevost followed proper procedures. They stated that Prevost personally received and attended to the victims, and reportedly opened an initial canonical investigation. He also encouraged the victims to take the case to the civil authorities. In July 2022, Prevost sent the results of the investigation to the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith (DDF) for review. His supporters stress that he has documents from the DDF and the Papal Nunciature in Peru which also indicate that he was not only attentive to the presumed victims, but that he did all required in Church law in following procedures set out for these cases.4<p>&quot;However, in May 2025 allegations emerged that the diocese paid $150,000 to the three girls to silence them. Described as “longtime public critics of Prevost,” the girls reportedly blame Prevost for covering up their sexual abuse by the priest.<p>&quot;The allegations, reported in InfoVaticana, described the Peruvian scandal, which was the subject of a national television report including an interview with the girls last fall, as the “stone in the shoe for Cardinal Prevost.”",

              "text": "From Catholic News Agency [1], for your convenience:\nThe history of the white smoke, which indicates that the cardinals have elected a new successor of St. Peter, is ancient. In 1274, at the Second Council of Lyons, Pope Gregory X, in a document titled Ubi Periculum, determined the procedure for holding a conclave. \nThere he specified that the election would be done in isolation and with strict secrecy. For this reason, and to avoid any communication with the outside, the smoke signal was eventually adopted as part of the ritual. The tradition of burning ballots goes back to at least 1417, and likely before then, according to historian Frederic J. Baumgartner. The addition of the white spoke to announce the election of a new pope is more recent, however. Baumgartner traces it to 1914, with the election of Pope Benedict XV.\nIf the smoke coming out of the chimney of the Sistine Chapel is black, it means that none of the proposed candidates has reached two-thirds of the votes needed to be elected. If the smoke is white, the Church has a new universal pastor. \nIn ancient times, the method to give the smoke these colors was to burn the ballots used in the voting with a bit of wet straw so that it would come out black, or dry so as to obtain white smoke. \nNowadays, and due to some episodes that caused confusion, special chemical compounds and a procedure that includes two different tubes, one for each color of smoke, are used. \nIn addition, a bell is rung, part of the ritual introduced when Pope Benedict XVI was elected, which confirms the smoke is white and a new pope has been elected.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.catholicnewsagency.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;263867&#x2F;the-story-behind-habemus-papam-and-the-white-smoke-annoucing-a-new-pope\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.catholicnewsagency.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;263867&#x2F;the-story-beh...</a>",

They actively analyze such cases individually with no default presumption.<p>Pope Leo XIV will lose his US citizenship due to his acceptance of the papacy if and only if he intended to relinquish US citizenship by that act, based on the standard of proof of the preponderance of the evidence (the same as in civil lawsuits).

Western mass media is extraordinarily effective in fostering within the general public enormous sympathy for beliefs and practices that are at odds with the Gospel.\n   \n   However, overt opposition to Christianity by mass media is only part of the problem. The sympathy for anti-Christian lifestyle choices that mass media fosters is so brilliantly and artfully engrained in the viewing public, that when people hear the Christian message it often inevitably seems ideological and emotionally cruel by contrast to the ostensible humaneness of the anti-Christian perspective.\n\n   If the “New Evangelization” is going to counter these mass media-produced distortions of religious and ethical reality successfully, pastors, preachers, teachers and catechists are going to have to become far more informed about the challenge of evangelizing in a world dominated by mass media.\n\n   The Fathers of the Church, including Saint Augustine, can provide eminent guidance for the Church in this aspect of the New Evangelization, precisely because they were masters of the art of rhetoric. Their evangelizing was successful in great part because they understood the foundations of social communication appropriate to the world in which they lived.\n\n   In order to combat successfully the dominance of the mass media over popular religious and moral imaginations, it is not sufficient for the Church to own its own television media or to sponsor religious films. The proper mission of the Church is to introduce people to the nature of mystery as an antidote to spectacle. Religious life also plays an important role in evangelization, pointing others to this mystery, through living faithfully the evangelical counsels.</code></pre>",

And also, even if gay sex is forbidden, you could still hold that gay couples are allowed to get married and adopt children, but that they should remain celibate. That&#x27;s rough, but Christians commonly hold that heterosexuals aren&#x27;t supposed to have non-procreative sex either. For comparison, the American Jewish Conservative movement holds that male-on-male anal sex is biblically prohibited, but all other aspects of gay relationships are permitted.

There is no macro for this. On platforms I know about, it varies from 4K to 64K. Setting it to a higher multiple of 2 is by design always safe.<p>* the known-constant page size that unconstrained `mmap` is guaranteed to return a multiple of. There is no macro for this. This is 4K on every platform I know about, but I&#x27;m not omniscient. Setting it to a lower multiple of 2 is by design always safe.<p>* the dynamic page size that the current kernel is actually using. You can get this using `getpagesize()` or `sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)` (incidentally the man page for `getpagesize(2)` is outdated by assuming page size only varies by machine, not at boot time)<p>The macro `PAGESIZE` is traditionally provided if the upper&#x2F;lower bounds are identical, and very many programs rely on it. Unfortunately, there&#x27;s no way to ask the kernel to <i>increase</i> the alignment that unconstrained `mmap` returns, which would safely allow defining PAGESIZE to the largest possible value.<p>Note that it <i>is</i> possible to get compiler errors for incompatible definitions of constants (or ranges thereof) by relying on `ld` magic (each value pulls in variable definied in a distinct object file that also defines an additional shared variable, causing multiple-definition errors), but this would need to be done by whoever provides the macros (which should be libc).",

Having not been born a king, Ramses used the obelisk as a propaganda tool early in his reign to reinforce his supremacy and divine nature.<p>Fun facts, prophet Moses is the most mentioned prophet in the Quran even more than Muhammad. The main protagonist during Moses time is Pharaoh and his fake claim of divinity is recorded verbatim in the Quran [1].<p>Pharaoh declared, “O chiefs! I know of no other god for you but myself. So bake bricks out of clay for me, O  Hamân, and build a high tower so I may look at the God of Moses, although I am sure he is a liar.”<p>[1] Quran Surah Al-Qasas (The Story): Ayat 38:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quran.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;al-qasas&#x2F;38\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quran.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;al-qasas&#x2F;38</a>",

I&#x27;m open to discovering that maybe the originator of the theory was misunderstood by the media, maybe his wording was not clear enough. I guess what I want to say is when you want clicks there&#x27;s more than one way to do it; my way would roughly be (1) criticize use of the term &#x27;cryptography&#x27; when all they do is tell me what they see in the picture: king giving offerings to god; king&#x27;s sitting on a mat(?), god&#x27;s standing on a plinth (as is customary); (2) criticize the very specific interpretation they give for this particular depiction when we find this same motive all over the place, all of the time; (3) criticize the claim that only nobles travelling by boat would have been able to see and understand the message when in Ancient Egypt taking a boat to cross the river as well as, as a local of Thebes, taking part in festivities must both have been very commonplace for old and young, rich and poor alike; also, artists in general and, for example, the foremen of worker gangs working on Khufu&#x27;s pyramid were very well able to use writing and depictions to express themselves.",

          "text": "While hieroglyphic cryptography is a thing (as is BTW &quot;sportive orthography&quot; in Ancient Egyptian), this is not it. I am all for acknowledging that Ancient Egyptian art is often merging writing and depiction in a way that escapes the unprepared who would point to a prominent figure in a grave wall decoration and say &#x27;this is a picture&#x27;, then point to some hieroglyphs and say &#x27;that is writing&#x27;. It&#x27;s in principle not wrong but misses the point that frequently the choice of hieroglyphs, their orientation and variations in orthography correspond to details of the depicted subject, while the pictures can often be read out, either by describing the participants and their actions, or by naming the parts.<p>As for the latter, there&#x27;s a statue of &quot;Ramesses II (Dyn XIX) as a Child&quot;[1] which shows Horus as a falcon with the sun (<i>rꜥ</i>) on his breast, a child (<i>ms</i>) beneath it, in his hand a sedge plant (<i>sw</i>). Naming the parts—sun, child, sedge—in this order gives <i>rꜥmssw</i>, vocalized <i>raꜥmissaw</i>, roughly maybe approximately [raʕ&#x27;missaw], in any event the very name of Ramesses, meaning &quot;He is &#x2F; was born &#x2F; brought forth by Ra &#x2F; the Sun&quot;. Note that you&#x27;ll have to choose to omit <i>ḥr</i> &quot;Horus&quot; although the falcon dominates the sculpture, and that the sedge does not represent a plant but, by virtue of sounding like it, the 3rd person suffix <i>sw</i> &quot;he&quot;, so there&#x27;s some guesswork involved. All said, it&#x27;s a fine example of a &quot;rebus&quot;.<p>Neither rebus reading nor pictorial description are commonly classified as cryptographic orthography in Egyptology.<p>The statue demonstrates nicely how acutely aware of their language, their artistic traditions and their writing Egyptian artists were. When we look at the depiction of Pharaoh and Amun on the obelisk as explained by Olette-Pelletier, however, we hardly see any of this. Yes, an arm with an offering on the palm of the hand was often used to write <i>dy</i> &quot;to give&quot;, but usually those offerings are triangular bread loaves, not round <i>nw</i> vessels. Yes, the hieroglyph for &quot;ḥtp&quot; looks like a flat rectangle but, again, with a bread offering on it which is missing from the flat rectangle that pharaoh is kneeling on.<p>I really wonder what the fuzz is about; clearly it&#x27;s a picture of the king giving offering to the god, and all he does is read out the picture. This is something that you can do with a lot of Egyptian art: there&#x27;s the king, you know him by the distinctive crown, and there&#x27;s Amun, which you know again by his distinctive headdress sporting two long feathers. The king is kneeling because he&#x27;s offering, and he has his arms stretched out presenting stuff because he&#x27;s, well, giving. The king is giving things to the god. What part of that was not known before, what part of that is cryptographic?<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Ramesses_II_as_child.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Ramesses_II_as_child.jpg</a>",

The filter&#x2F;apply pattern they use when trying to narrow things down is a lot quicker than waiting for Mcmaster&#x27;s auto updating window. Usually, when I&#x27;m looking for something, it&#x27;s not for an exact specific item, but to know what options are even there in the first place. Selecting ranges of things in McMaster has always felt a little cumbersome, but Digikey has always had it right.<p>The other thing McMaster does that&#x27;s kind of annoying, but also kind of funny, is that they go out of their way to purge the branding of the items they stock. Very understandable why they do that, but sometimes they do it when it doesn&#x27;t make sense.

You want to get in, get value, and get out as quickly as possible so you can move on to delivering value to your business.<p>Slack used to be good at this when it was just about IM, but then they became all about replacing other forms of communication... the problem is they weren&#x27;t as good, some email does need to be email. Engagement went up, but &quot;managing Slack&quot; was a big time sink. My old company trialled Facebook Workplace, and probably because it was built with a social network mindset instead of a productivity tool mindset, it was an immediate time sink with very little value.<p>There are lots of examples of the flip side, UI that gets out of the way, but they&#x27;re usually pretty boring.",

I feel like a lot of websites do the opposite - they look nice, but using them is a pain.<p>(Conversely, most staff hated new EMRs, because it enforced doing things the hospital wants its staff to do for liability and billing, but the staff doesn&#x27;t want to do - for example, asking Maternity nurses to talk to new mothers about smoking cessation.)",

I worked a place where it was the implementation team&#x27;s first time, but they listened heavily to requests from different departments. The most common request was to reduce the number of different views and screens, compared to the old custom software that was being replaced. Resizable fonts without having to change screen resolutions was another one.Staff also wanted to keep the rest as much the same as possible, but add a few little things here and there..<p>The new EMR software was highly configurable, so lots of this happened. Staff teams signed off on it, and had training from the implementation team.<p>Fewer screens? Check! …Wellll, sorta: some very long scrolling views…which didn&#x27;t play nice with mousewheels. It would seem like the page randomly and mysteriously stoppe scrolling, then suddenly scroll normally. There were lots of weird data entry errors, from all staff, regardless of prior reputation for accuracy. They were just getting used to new software, right? Nope. I tracked this down to the dropdown lists scattered on the long scrolling pages. As a page scrolled, random lists ate scroll events, changed the list item to either the first or last item, then permitted scrolling to continue.<p>Fonts worked mostly great…except some of the typefaces follow the should-be-criminal design of allowing various characters to to look identical. Font sizing worked as expected. I think Pre-cert desk liked Candara, for the way numbers stood out.<p>Notes fields…these were our downfall, sometimes multiple times per day. Anything put into them was inserted as raw text into SQL:<p>Patient said xxxxxxx -- ESR<p>…or…<p>something-something &#x27;quoted thing&#x27;<p>…would mean the database locked up, no exams savable or queryable, no patient intake, no checkout until I.T. admin could fix it. The implementation team was gone, and non-responsive, so sticky notes with a list of forbidden characters seemed to be everywhere.<p>I believe some contracts for referrals were lost, due to delays and errors. Some staff quit, after months of no fixes. But I later heard from one of the most affected staffers that the same EMR software was installed at our biggest competitor, and no issues at all.",

There are cascading impacts of these decisions as well, a field which is 48px tall must have a significant amount of padding around it as well, to look balanced with the field size. Typically the rule of thumb i&#x27;ve seen designers use is 50% of the field height. When you factor in field label sitting above the field things get even bigger. I did however recently find a pretty nice solution which moves the field label inside the field, allowing for a slightly more compact layout while still hitting the tap target size requirements. \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m2.material.io&#x2F;components&#x2F;text-fields#filled-text-field\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m2.material.io&#x2F;components&#x2F;text-fields#filled-text-fi...</a>",

A lot of engineering&#x2F;manufacturing parts suppliers tend to have good information dense websites that are really catered to their customers for finding parts.<p>Take mouser.com, digikey.com, grainger.com rockauto.com or mcmaster.com. They all have a bit of a &quot;landing page&quot; but once you go to search for parts you&#x27;ve got something that was really designed to be an intuitive parts search. Compare that with jameco.com which competes with mouser&#x2F;digikey but has a more classic webshop search system. It’s a bit more frustrating to use.<p>Some news sites also do a great job of presenting headlines and highlights well in a small area. I think semafor.com is probably my current favorite, but I&#x27;ll readily admit that it&#x27;s not the most information dense.<p>CAD software also tends to be good at this, but that might be just because the UI has chugged along since the 90&#x27;s. AutoCAD&#x2F;Inventor&#x2F;Solidworks&#x2F;SolidEdge&#x2F;KiCAD&#x2F;Altium&#x2F;Virtuoso are all great examples where if you&#x27;ve got prior experience with them (or even similar software) you can sit down and quickly get up to speed on a project and see what&#x27;s been done. I think the distinction is that a lot of software&#x2F;websites are designed to keep the average user focused on a single aspect and so they are designed to either remove or hide the complexity but for more “professional” level tools you need all that data and information. You can probably blame (for better or for worse) material UI for a lot of this spaced-out thing. In my mind that was the first mobile first UI scheme that really took off and it&#x27;s basically influenced everything that&#x27;s come sense then. Computer first software might be your best bet to get some examples. Because a lot of the web is mobile first&#x2F;mobile forward now you probably aren&#x27;t going to find a lot of examples on that. I would love to see examples of information dense mobile first sites.<p>A few other examples I just wanted to brain dump:<p>- labgopher.com<p>- tld-list.com<p>- The Bloomberg Terminal<p>- Ghidra<p>- Most plane cockpits, especially modern fighter planes if you ever get to see&#x2F;sit on one.<p>- A lot of “professional level creative software” – Reaper, Affinity<p>- Train control and monitoring systems",

          "text": "Another vote for ableton. Also After Effects. Comparing legacy vs new (rush, etc) Adobe video editing UI is a good way to see both of these dynamics in action. I used to work on the UI kits for Adobe. We supported multiple densities for this reason.<p>Something you&#x27;ll find in both ableton and after effects are smart, adaptable panel abstractions&#x2F;conventions. Both have fairly rigid application frames and large distinct sections where discrete types of work happen. But they also have panels where things can get nearly to a free for all. Think custom video effect controls, or individual midi instruments. There are norms (knobs look and work similarly), but things can get totally custom as well (custom graphs, etc). Lastly, at the very edge (~1% of use cases), there are ways to escape the constraints of UI entirely. AE has a code editor for things like custom wiggle animations. Ableton has M4L (which subsequently supports JS and possibly some C, IIRC). You can get yourself into trouble here in ways you normally couldn&#x27;t: it&#x27;s possible to straight up break things.<p>Greedy whitespace nonwithstanding, the most pernicious modern UI trend you&#x27;ll need to buck is the idea that your UI should be simple because it is for simple people. Sometime UI is cluttered because of sloppy design or bad abstractions. Sometimes UI is cluttered because it&#x27;s meant to empower people who think and care about multiple things simultaneously. Modern UI trends will tell you not to serve a man a steak because a baby can&#x27;t chew it. Serve steak, babies be damned.<p>I guess that was mostly about functionality, and only adjacent to density. For actual density: vintage (2016ish?) 538 tables, vintage (pre 2010?) stockkeeping and cashier UI. These are basically TUIs with just a hair more polish.  \n* Much less text heirarchy. This means even line heights, which means easy dense grid layouts. Achieve contrast with boldness rather than size, side borders, inverted backgrounds, etc.\n* The opposite extreme: very big items for very big tasks. Wide touch areas for each food item that a server can rapidfire tap through, everything else tucked to the side.\n* Thoughtful truncation: grid layouts often ask that things overflow. Do they elipsis at the end? Do they drop the middle? Do they condense 3 pieces of information into 3 smaller pieces of information? Etc.\n* Prefer text to icons for all buttons, menus, etc. A tab menu of just text is easy to parse. Icons add noise, and non-text buttons force users to speculate instead of read.\n* Intentionally non-responsive panels. Having fixed sizes for sidebars, panels, etc makes it easier to reason about how subcomponents snap to grid, and greatly shrinks the workload created by having to allow for fluid item reflow.",

Matter of taste of the Controller, industry specific bits, etc. While everyone has a chart of accounts, no two chart of accounts are the same.<p>So, anyway, we ate our own dog food, we used our own accounting system in house for, you know, accounting stuff.<p>But the funny thing is that when you opened up the Accounts Receivable Invoice screen, and this is on an 80x25 color terminal, I would say it was 60%+ a collection of fields regarding the invoice. Customer, dates, terms, etc. Probably 20 fields on that screen, all crammed together, because real estate was always an issue on 80x25 terminals.<p>But, we were a simple business, and the bulk of those fields are optional for specific use cases, and those options are based on the customer.<p>So, when you entered in the customer for the invoice, 80% of the fields just vanished from the screen. Feature of the system. But it made a very busy screen into something quite stark. It doesn&#x27;t resize, it just makes the field go away. The top half of the screen was, essentially, blank.<p>I always found it amusing to see all of that information vanish.",

The prototype is based off of CNN&#x27;s &quot;lite&quot; headlines page (&lt;<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lite.cnn.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lite.cnn.com&#x2F;</a>&gt;), which presents 100 headlines in an unorganised fashion without context.<p>My first cut simply organised the headlines by section and date.  The version linked above includes several lede &#x27;graphs for each article, along with some other formatting.  It runs about 15 or so screens on either my desktop or mobile (large-format tablet) devices.<p>I&#x27;m looking at extending the concept to other &#x2F; additional news sources, largely as CNN&#x27;s article offerings are disappointingly irrelevant.  (Discussed in the Diaspora* thread.)<p>Features I&#x27;m thinking of adding include:<p>- Bayesian ordering by significance.  (This will be based on my own article judgements used as training data.)<p>- A &quot;best of the interval&quot; capability.<p>- Adding in articles from several alternative sources.  <i>The Guardian</i> will likely be the baseline given its well-structured nature, reasonably comprehensive news, and lack of a paywall.  There are likely a few other sources I&#x27;ll add.  I&#x27;d like to include weather and perhaps some business ticker data as well.  I&#x27;ve had previous ideas about a &quot;news dashboard&quot; which tracks significant indicators, and would like to try applying several of those concepts, if my coding chops are up to it.<p>- Possibly a bit of visual flash, though from what I&#x27;m observing, virtually all graphics used on news sites are more distraction than value.<p>- Incorporating eInk-Mode: &lt;<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=43690828\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=43690828</a>&gt;",

It&#x27;s an excellent article from the Wiz team.<p>GitHub Actions is particularly vulnerable to a lot of different vectors, and I think a lot of folks reach for the self-hosted option and believe that closes up the majority of them, but it really doesn&#x27;t. If anything, it might open more vectors and potentially scarier ones (i.e., a persistent runner could be compromised, and if you got your IAM roles wrong, they now have access to your AWS infrastructure).<p>When we first started building Depot GitHub Actions Runners [0], we designed our entire system to never trust the actual EC2 instance backing the runner. The same way we treat our Docker image builders. Why? They&#x27;re executing untrusted code that we don&#x27;t control.<p>So we launch a GitHub Actions runner for a Depot user in 2-5 seconds, let it run its job with zero permissions at the EC2 level, and then kill the instance from orbit to never be seen again. We explicitly avoid the persistent runner, and the IAM role of the instance is effectively {}.<p>For folks reading the Wiz article. This is the line that folks should be thinking about when going the self-hosted route:<p>&gt; Self-hosted runners execute Jobs directly on machines you manage and control. While this flexibility is useful, it introduces significant security risks, as GitHub explicitly warns in their documentation. Runners are non-ephemeral by default, meaning the environment persists between Jobs. If a workflow is compromised, attackers may install background processes, tamper with the environment, or leave behind persistent malware.<p>&gt; To reduce the attack surface, organizations should isolate runners by trust level, using runner groups to prevent public repositories from sharing infrastructure with private ones. Self-hosted runners should never be used with public repositories. Doing so exposes the runner to untrusted code, including Workflows from forks or pull requests. An attacker could submit a malicious workflow that executes arbitrary code on your infrastructure.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;depot.dev&#x2F;products&#x2F;github-actions\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;depot.dev&#x2F;products&#x2F;github-actions</a>",

Any infrastructure or data mutable by a workflow involving pull requests should be burned to the ground after that workflow completes. You can achieve this with ephemeral runners with JIT tokens, where the complete VM is disposed of after the job completes.<p>As always the principle of least-privilege is your friend.<p>If you stick to that, ephemeral self-hosted runners on disposable infrastructure are a solid, high-performance, cost-effective choice.<p>We built exactly this at Sprinters [0] for your own AWS account, but there are many other good solutions out there too if you keep this in mind.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sprinters.sh\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sprinters.sh</a>",

It also contained ~200 shared libraries used by different subsets of the services. Running the entire unit-test suite took about 1.5 hours. Running the integration tests for everything took about 8 hours and the burn-in behavioral QA tests took 3-4 days. Waiting for the entire test suite to run for every PR is untenable so you start adding complexity to trim down what gets run only to what is relevant to the changes.<p>A PR would run the unit tests only for the services that had changes included in it. Library changes would also trigger the unit tests in any of the services that depended on them. Some sets of unit tests still required services, some didn&#x27;t. We used an in-house action that mapped the files changed to relevant sets of tests to run.<p>When we updated a software dependency, we had a separate in-house action that would locate all the services that use that dependency and attempt to set them attempt to set them to the same value, running the subsequent tests.<p>Dependency caching is a big one and frankly Github&#x27;s built-in cacheing is so incredibly buggy and inconsistent it can&#x27;t be relied on... So third party there. It keeps going on:<p>- Associating bug reports to recent changes<p>- Ensuring PRs and issues meet your compliance obligations around change management<p>- Ensuring changes touching specific lines of code have specific reviewers (CODEOWNERS is not always sufficiently granular)<p>- Running vulnerability scans<p>- Running a suite of different static and lint checkers<p>- Building, tagging, and uploading container artifacts for testing and review<p>- Building and publishing documentation and initial set of release notes for editing and review<p>- Notifying out to slack when new releases are available<p>- Validating certain kinds of changes are backported to supported versions<p>Special branches might trigger additional processes like running a set of upgrade and regression tests from previously deployed versions (especially if you&#x27;re supporting long-term support releases).<p>That was a bit off the top of my head.

There&#x27;s far too much of that to worry about. But that doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;ll change to accommodate everyone else. The entire point is to provide something that <i>isn&#x27;t</i> available everywhere you look: a polished artifact, an organized repository of commonly-needed, high-quality answers to clear, focused, practical questions.<p>Do we <i>accomplish</i> that goal? Hell no, not by a long shot. But there <i>are</i> some real gems in there - and a few of them have millions of views. And as the rate of new questions slows, users who put on the &quot;curator&quot; hat become able to keep on top of the incoming queue, filter through for what&#x27;s of value (and not a duplicate), and even turn attention towards the <i>old</i> Q&amp;A to improve it (incidentally, a <i>lot</i> of that work is rounding up old duplicates that went unnoticed).<p>&gt; I had forgotten that any external links are a big no-no in SO land, so my question immediately attracted 2 close votes.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t simply including an external link (we&#x27;ll happily just edit those out if they aren&#x27;t necessary). The problem occurs when a question <i>appears to depend upon</i> the externally linked content. We can&#x27;t accept that (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;254428\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;254428</a>) because of link rot and licensing issues (someone who wants to answer you often needs to be able to cite the code; posting on-site automatically licenses the content appropriately, per the terms of service) but mainly because of <i>scope</i> - a question that&#x27;s suitable for the Stack Exchange format would fit neatly within the actual question text.<p>We don&#x27;t want to do detailed analysis of the problem you encountered, even if we&#x27;re capable of it, because <i>questions are for everyone</i>. They need to be able to reflect a problem that other people could a) have; b) plausibly search for; and c) recognize if they found it. Answers to a question need to make sense in general to people who would ask - not just in the specific context of one person&#x27;s original problem. In short, we <i>want a question, not a problem</i> - and extracting a proper question <i>starts with</i> (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;261592\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;261592</a>) your own analysis.<p>&quot;How do I do X?&quot; questions are usually much easier to ask in the format, and are very valuable and can end up very well regarded, even when they&#x27;re on very basic topics. But &quot;what went wrong with Y code?&quot; is not fully refined. What we&#x27;re really looking for is more like &quot;why does Y&#x27; code construct do Z?&quot; - where the <i>specific, exact cause</i> of failure (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;minimal-reproducible-example\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;minimal-reproducible-example</a>) is extracted from your own debugging session (along with reproducing input and actual vs expected output).<p>&gt; Two days later my question got it&#x27;s third vote for closure, and remains unanswered and now closed forever.<p>This is literally not how Stack Overflow works. The OP has at least (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;auto-deleted-questions\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;auto-deleted-questions</a>) 9 days to fix the question and nominate it for reopening until it gets &quot;deleted&quot;; but even then it&#x27;s a soft deletion (delisting) which is still reversible - you can find the question from your personal listing (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;users&#x2F;deleted-questions&#x2F;current\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;users&#x2F;deleted-questions&#x2F;current</a> while logged in; or replace &#x27;current&#x27; with your user ID), edit and nominate for undeletion.<p>The established policy is that we intentionally close questions that don&#x27;t meet standards (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;417476\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;417476</a>) <i>as quickly as possible</i> (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;260263\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;260263</a>). The main point of this is to prevent the sort of people (notice that <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;271684\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;271684</a> is over 10 years old; and the original complaint <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;9731\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;9731</a> is from <i>before the official launch</i>, during the private beta) who would otherwise hang out on a traditional discussion forum 12 hours a day from trying to read the OP&#x27;s mind, repost the same basic explanation of the same basic idea dozens of times, etc.<p>(Unfortunately, the incentive system is completely broken - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;387356\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;387356</a> - and the company&#x27;s interests are not aligned with the community, so this is a losing battle.)<p>And, in fact, your question <i>has been reopened</i>, as of about 3&#x2F;4 of an hour after your comment that I&#x27;m replying to. Stack Overflow is not at all immune to external pressure - after all, many regulars there are also <i>on</i> HN and other usual-suspect sites.<p>It also looks like your edits have actually improved the question. In particular, adding in a definite conclusion from your profiling attempt.<p>(We understand that a lot of people in a situation like yours wouldn&#x27;t necessarily know how to use a profiler and wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be able to come up with a theory about what&#x27;s wrong. That isn&#x27;t our problem. We aren&#x27;t offering tech support. It&#x27;s a bitter pill for almost everyone, but Stack Overflow <i>by design is not there to make your code work</i>. It&#x27;s there to <i>answer questions that arise</i> during your attempt. And a question like yours, properly refined, can help those other people.)",

There are many questions on SO where someone has asked what is the best library for X, and the question is closed due to site policy, but I think a discussion of what library is best for a use case is a very useful thing to have on SO.  The answer to the question can change over time, and multiple alternative solutions can be presented.  This is the kind of thing that Reddit has taken over for many different product recommendations, but reddit answers are just comments, they don&#x27;t have the UI of SO&#x27;s for commenting on questions and answers.",

(It took quite a while for the problem to be noticed and acted upon, in large part because of a moderation strike in June 2023 which ended up creating a large backlog of flags for AI content, and in part because custom flags are required to report this.

There are review queues which appear on the top nav incentivizing power users with enough rep to go in and take action like closing requests.<p>Having met many SO power users in group settings over the years, I feel that there is very little tolerance for questions that require effort to understand. If it&#x27;s a simple question posed by a non-English speaker that needs some thought, then it doesn&#x27;t belong (but that&#x27;s why comments were introduced later.) The same goes for a deeper technical question where the author gets it all out but doesn&#x27;t take the time to structure or format it. The volume of behavior like this differs based on the type of question and experts prepared to weigh in.<p>This gets compounded by the up and comers on the reputation scale. They get their special powers and see this BOFH close behavior and replicate it. Over time it starts to become the norm. I had the ability to vote for reopens and these same people would argue about why this was a bad idea. They weren&#x27;t prepared to admit they were wrong and felt they were doing God&#x27;s work by ridding the site of poor questions when some of us even had the ability to make edits to clarify them.<p>I just opened the site after some time away. At the top, pushing the question list below the fold, are: Reputation, Badge Progress, and Watched Tags blocks. The Interesting Posts for You question feed is below that and I have to go see how that is constructed. I only ever wanted the firehose of new questions with my tags highlighted.<p>EDIT: The behavior I noted above is yet example of why I always want to know how a job candidate deals with ambiguity.

We close old, popular questions all the time, because they don&#x27;t currently meet site standards (usually, because they are no longer deemed on topic). This is at least partly to discourage new questions along the same lines; but the primary effect of closing a question is to prevent answers from being contributed.

First and foremost, it&#x27;s not a democracy if your turnout is too low. The 2024 election had voter turnout of 2%, which would be a catastrophic turnout in any real democracy. Either too few knew about the election, too few thought their vote mattered, or too few had any idea how to choose between the options. Any of these reasons requires immediate and pressing attention if a democracy is to be called that.<p>2. Never having re-elections makes it useless. For it to be a truly democratic process there absolutely needs to be a way to withdraw consent from a moderator who behaves differently than expected. So yeah, a no confidence vote would be an option, or better yet regular elections to hold a position.<p>I&#x27;m afraid that the largest problem is that democracy is really just a bad fit for this kind of site. By its nature the only people who are likely to vote in this type of election are a small dedicated core, not the enormous number of users that the site actually serves. A small core of contributors to a community resource invariably seems to develop a sense of &quot;us against the world&quot;—the thin blue line of police lore isn&#x27;t an isolated thing, it&#x27;s what happens when people view themselves as lone defenders of something they care about. And just like with police, that can result in a toxic culture that begins to actively degrade the plebian outgroup that they started out serving.<p>I don&#x27;t have a better answer, but I don&#x27;t believe democracy is a good fit for moderators on the scale of community that Stack Overflow operates. It&#x27;s too big to have good turnout, and the problems caused by bad turnout have become catastrophic.",

That&#x27;s the site <i>working as designed and intended</i>.<p>&gt; What was becoming more common was that I would have a question similar to an existing unanswered one.<p>Then you should <i>improve the existing unanswered question</i> instead, and&#x2F;or draw attention to it (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;265874\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;265874</a> ; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;266338\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;266338</a>). Or, yes, answer it if you can. Thank you for doing so.<p>&gt; Or that my question would never receive an answer (presumably because my questions were becoming more tricky&#x2F;niche).<p>That&#x27;s a big presumption. I got an answer to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;75677825&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;75677825&#x2F;</a> within hours.<p>&gt; for some reason, a few years ago my questions started being closed for no apparent reason other than &quot;those who reviewed it have no clue and think that it is invalid&quot;<p>This is absolutely not what happened. First off, when your question is closed, you get a banner at the top of your question indicating which of the few standard close reasons was chosen. The wording isn&#x27;t always a great fit (especially in the cases where people voted for more than one close reason - please keep in mind that <i>we neither write this explanation nor get to choose the text</i>; it&#x27;s pulled from a database following simple mapping rules, and even moderators have only very indirect influence over that database) but it does normally point you in the right direction.<p>Second, &quot;I don&#x27;t know the answer&quot; is not a valid close reason. People constantly accuse (on the meta site and elsewhere) that someone else&#x27;s close vote was motivated by this; there&#x27;s never any real way to evidence that, and this kind of accusation is in fact what we consider toxic behaviour (an assumption of bad faith).<p>&gt; Many times they closed even though I had posted both the question and the answer at the same time (as a way to help others)!<p>The fact that you provide your own answer weighs exactly zero in the calculation of closing a question. It must meet the site standards. Part of the purpose of a question is to <i>index</i> the information in the answer - so no matter how brilliant your explanation of the underlying problem might be, your <i>exposition</i> of the problem is a limiting factor.<p>&gt; The first few times, I fought to get my question reopened and guess what? They all got a few tens of votes in the following year.<p>The community does make mistakes, in both directions. The meta site exists for a reason.<p>But part of &quot;fighting to get a question reopened&quot; is editing it. Changes you might think are trivial might be crucial according to our standards. Some questions fundamentally can&#x27;t be fixed; but when they can, closing a question signals that <i>the OP&#x27;s perspective is needed</i> to fix the problem, no matter how minor. If we could fix it (without worrying about trampling on your authorial intent), we would.<p>&gt;Still, that toxic moderation hasn&#x27;t changed. If anything, it has gotten worse.<p>It&#x27;s not moderation, but curation. It&#x27;s overwhelmingly done by a community of volunteers - not by the two dozen or so moderators (also volunteers) looking over an accumulation of literally millions of users and questions.<p>And it isn&#x27;t &quot;toxic&quot;. Overwhelmingly, people aren&#x27;t doing it out of any kind of vendetta or a desire to cause you or anyone else a problem. They&#x27;re doing it to uphold a standard (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;417476&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;417476&#x2F;</a>) designed (really, developed over many years by community discussion on the meta site) to accomplish particular goals (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;tour\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;tour</a> ; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;254770\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;254770</a>).<p>&gt; I am usually better off opening an issue or discussion directly with the upstream project<p>If it&#x27;s something that makes sense to handle this way, it probably doesn&#x27;t also make sense in the Q&amp;A format. We can&#x27;t do anything about your bug report.<p>&gt; I heard people mentioning that LLMs were hurting StackOverflow badly.<p>A lot of people think so because the volume of questions has dropped off dramatically, and there&#x27;s good evidence that people will ask an LLM instead of asking on Stack Overflow.<p>But this is <i>not at all</i> &quot;hurting Stack Overflow&quot;, unless you&#x27;re a staff member at the company and you specifically worry about the effect of this decline on ad revenue.<p>If asking an LLM - trained on millions of existing Stack Overflow questions, along with the rest of the Internet - gives you an actually working answer (and you&#x27;re either in a position where you can deal with AI hallucinations, or are lucky enough not to experience one), then that is, almost certainly, not a question that helps improve the existing resource that is Stack Overflow. It&#x27;s most likely a duplicate or near-duplicate.<p>Duplicate questions on Stack Overflow are not inherently bad; sometimes rephrasing a question helps by providing a &quot;signpost&quot; so that people who think about a problem in a different way can realize that it&#x27;s still the same problem, and there&#x27;s still the same fundamental question to answer about it. But we want everyone who has that question to find the same collection of answers; and we want that collection of answers to be high quality, not redundant, and categorized under a high quality version of the question. That way, when you use a search engine and find Stack Overflow Q&amp;A, you get the best possible result, as quickly as possible.<p>Nowadays, there are about <i>three times</i> as many publicly available questions on Stack Overflow as there are <i>articles on Wikipedia</i>. Considering that the scope of Stack Overflow is &quot;practical questions about programming&quot;, while the scope of Wikipedia is &quot;literally any noteworthy real-world object or phenomenon&quot;, that&#x27;s <i>clearly</i> too many already. So why worry about the influx of new questions slowing down?",

You do not have to specifically call the Close method. Instead, ensure that every Stream object is properly disposed.<p>My stream is properly disposed.<p>Claude also sticks in things like:<p><pre><code>                &#x2F;&#x2F; Simulate some work or add a small delay to prevent CPU spinning\n                Thread.Sleep(1);\n</code></pre>\nI can&#x27;t see how that do anything to solve my issue. I suppose I should humour the machine, go full-vibe and try everything it suggests, and if I end up with a working solution go back from there, but I fear that would just leave me more confused about the underlying mechanisms here.<p>On the client side it not only rewrites my reading to read multiple times, but adds in:<p><pre><code>                    await Task.Delay(500, cts.Token); &#x2F;&#x2F; Small delay between reads\n</code></pre>\nI didn&#x27;t ask it to re-introduce the loop, and a 500ms delay between reads is horribly long for reading successive bytes from a stream.<p>The only thing that was interesting was creaitng a linked cancellation token source on the service to pass to the underlying stream and cancelling it on server shutdown.<p>That&#x27;s a useful thing to keep in mind to help with helping to shutdown the services, but doesn&#x27;t actually address the issue for a server you want to keep running.<p>It does also add send&#x2F;receive timeouts too, and they&#x27;re also worth keeping in mind, but that doesn&#x27;t seem like a good mechanism for dealing with this issue. If anything, it would just mask the issue by having it write to the stream for the duration of the timeout period instead, which if short could cause a problem like this to go unnoticed until it&#x27;s actually under more load.",

But the study doesn’t treat it as a direct window into brain function. Instead, it proposes a predictive attention mechanism (PAM) that learns to selectively weigh signals from different brain areas, depending on the task of reconstructing perceived images from those signals.<p>The “thermal imager” analogy might make sense in a different context, but in this case, the model is explicitly designed to deal with those signal differences and works across both modalities.

However, while the identification process itself is faster, MALDI-MS-based analysis suffers from the same time-consuming isolation step as traditional approaches. Time, however, is a decisive factor in the successful treatment of several infection scenarios such as sepsis4,8. Consequently, the ideal scenario of microbial diagnosis is to identify bacteria directly from the clinical sample. Using MALDI, so far only a small number of applications could be implemented due to the high protein background in most clinical samples9.&quot;<p>While mass spectrometry is an old(-ish) method, only recently has it become good  and fast enough for clinical use. They also needed to make their own database of bacterial byproduct signatures to look for, as that did not exist yet.<p>As to &quot;why just now&quot;: not everything has been invented yet, even things that might seem relatively straightforward.",

Gates himself appears like a rarity among them now, with a bit of a conscience and sense of public responsibility.

Despite spending most of his time at twitter last year, Tesla was trying to set Musk&#x27;s compensation at over $100 billion[1].  For what, exactly?<p>Bill Gates was every bit the problem billionaire in his own time. Only a tiny proportion of billionaires ever decide to engage in significant philanthropy, much of which wouldn&#x27;t be necessary if their peers weren&#x27;t draining society of the capital to do it&#x27;s own research and building.  Some argue that billionaires can serve society by hoarding resources and then directing them intelligently in directions governments are too stupid to consider, but that argument falls flat if <i>most</i> billionaires never get past the hoarding stage.  Gates has called on his peers to do more.  Few have listened.<p>It&#x27;s great that a few former robber barons are engaged in serious philanthropy, but it&#x27;s like slapping a band-aid on a bullet wound.  It would be far better to stop the shooting.  Reigning in executive pay would be a solid start.

These days you have Warren Buffett or Saros doing the same.<p>Many in tech were along for the Bill Gates show and felt he was a negative actor to the industry in many ways.   The fact that he is taking that wealth and channeling it through charity to achieve what he believes is important worries many on both sides of the political divide because of the enormous amounts of power he has.<p>Specifically over the foundation:\n1. Influence Over Public Policy\nCriticism: The foundation’s massive financial power allows it to heavily influence public health, education, and agricultural policy, sometimes without democratic oversight.<p>Example: In education, their support for charter schools and Common Core standards drew criticism for pushing reforms without enough input from teachers and communities.<p>2. Pharmaceutical and Vaccine Influence\nCriticism: The foundation has been accused of favoring pharmaceutical-based solutions, sometimes at the expense of broader public health approaches.<p>Example: Critics argue that funding pharmaceutical companies during vaccine rollouts (especially during COVID-19) prioritized private profits over equitable global access.<p>3. Corporate Ties\nCriticism: The foundation has invested in companies that contradict its stated goals (e.g., Coca-Cola, ExxonMobil), raising ethical questions.<p>Example: Investments in fossil fuel companies were seen as inconsistent with health and development goals.<p>4. Global South Criticism\nCriticism: Some argue that Gates Foundation programs in Africa and other regions can be top-down, lacking local input, and continuing a form of “philanthropic colonialism.”<p>5. Agricultural Interventions\nCriticism: Through the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), the foundation promoted industrial farming and GMOs.<p>Response: Some say this undermines traditional, sustainable farming practices and increases dependence on multinational corporations for seeds and fertilizers.<p>6. COVID-19 Vaccine Access\nCriticism: Gates opposed waiving IP rights for COVID-19 vaccines, which some argued delayed access in poorer countries.<p>Defense: The foundation claimed that maintaining IP was key to quality and speed, though many public health experts disagreed.<p>He is an interesting and unique character who achieved much but don&#x27;t polish those angel wings just yet.",

Bill Gates fought against technological progress, fought against free and open source software, fought against antitrust, even bribed officials to push out competitors. Why would people pat each other on the back for admiring him?<p>Even afterwards, when he bought his redemption by showering money upon dubious nonprofits, and by creating other, even more dubious nonprofits - simply paying everyone who could possibly have a problem with him, including dozens of journalistic organizations and hundreds of individual journalists - all of his charitable efforts are still obviously ways to play with various social theories that he has, not to help people.<p>It takes a real psychopath to accumulate that much power, with so few principles, and then to use it to play games with people&#x27;s lives. His entertainment and the entertainment of his class is endangering the world.<p>And I still listen to Michael Jackson, so whatever, but we know that his relationship with Epstein was pretty extensive, and what was said during his divorce (in relation to that) was alarming, as well as the fact that he immediately crumbled and gave her the farm. There&#x27;s your conspiracy theory; I&#x27;m not going to be caught praising a guy for mosquito nets whom I pretty much knew hung out with Epstein for a time as intensely as anyone else did. Epstein was giving away money for elite approval, too.<p>What&#x27;s money for if not for patronage? You can&#x27;t take it with you.",

The higher the frequency, the less far you go. Of course, weaker signals are harder to distinguish from noise so there’s only so weak your signal can go. If you want to control drones, lower frequencies are better.<p>There’s a reason that microwaves (the cooking instrument, named after the rough band of RF frequencies it uses) interfere with WiFi when improperly shielded: they run at approximately 2.4GHz. That’s a part of the band that’s free to use without licensing (ISM band, runs at 900MHz, 2.4GHz, 5Ghz, and so on). That’s because microwave manufacturers don’t want to license spectrum, and it’s the part of the ISM band closest to the ideal absorption frequency of water. The point of microwaves is to push energy into water molecules and make them move around faster, aka heat them. Water molecules do that well at 2.4GHz. This also means that water blocks RF at that frequency very well, because it absorbs it. Trying to shoot 2.4GHz WiFi through trees sucks because it gets blocked by the leaves.<p>So you want to control drones. You can’t be around 2.4GHz because rain would screw you up. You can’t go above that so you can get enough distance. You can’t go as low as 900MHz or other stuff on the ISM band might interfere with you.<p>Not that much left, given that 1.7GHz is a popular cell phone frequency, and so on - you can look at publicly available frequency charts to see what’s assigned for what where.<p>This glosses over a lot and is heavily simplified.",

Amazed at an exhibit on wartime manufacturing, he turned to me and said, &quot;This is so unbelievable to me. To think what we accomplished when everyone in the country was pulling in the same direction. There&#x27;s no way that could happen anymore.&quot; I hardly want to glorify warfare, but he has a point. As a young person in our chaotic and ambiguous present day looking back into the haze of the past, there really is something incredibly romantic about the era of war mobilization. Ordinary people had a purpose simply assigned to them, and if nothing else I think it&#x27;s still the case that people in all eras crave purpose.",

We&#x27;re attracted (or not) to the <i>tiniest</i> differences in physiology. If you doubt this, try this exercise: Pretend you&#x27;ve just met green aliens and have to explain to them how to reliably tell the difference between men and women from appearance alone! Now explain why <i>that</i> particular girl (or boy) is very pretty&#x2F;handsome, but not <i>that</i> one.<p>It&#x27;s one of those topics where the more you know, the more freaky it is.<p>DNA does not -- to our knowledge -- directly encode the &quot;weights&quot; of our neurons! It can&#x27;t <i>possibly</i> because there are far more synapses than there bits of information in our genes. Also, most of those genes are dedicated to non-brain parts of the body plan and to the low-level machinery of our cellular biochemistry.<p>Secondly, DNA has only an indirect effect of our development: it encodes for proteins, which then provide chemical signals such as concentration gradients that guide cell division. It&#x27;s a bit like playing SimCity, where the players&#x27; control is limited to zoning and road topology. The individual Sims are not directly controllable and behave stochastically.<p>Solving this problem is so freakishly difficult for even the incredible brute force of parallel search of evolution only managed to discover a solution a few times in a billion years.<p>Our attraction to our partners is a genetic heritage shared with <i>all</i> mammals, going back hundreds of millions of years. That&#x27;s why Furry is a thing, but not Featherry. Birds are a different <i>class</i> from us mammals and don&#x27;t share the same &quot;partner attraction wiring&quot; genes. (This is closely related to why all mammal babies are cute to humans, but baby bird chicks are generally repulsive.)<p>Because this is a hard problem to solve, the few solutions that were discovered had to be reused by entire classes of Animalia. I would hazard a guess that <i>this</i> is precisely what defines a “class” in taxonomy! If there were intelligent birds, their equivalent of Furry would be Featherry, and their crimes of bestiality would be with other non-intelligent birds, not mammals.<p>With LLMs, we got to see a glimpse into the possible mechanisms of intelligence, and what it might take to design or evolve one.<p>The LLM equivalent of this kind of encoding would be to design a model architecture that falls in love with a specific, narrowly selected, subset of its users. Keep in mind that I&#x27;m not talking about a learned or specifically tuned set of model weights! The <i>architecture</i> is where the attraction is encoded, such as selecting some complex variant or combination of Transformers, Mamba, or CNNs that just &quot;so happen&quot; to result in the model preferentially learning to be attracted to certain styles of conversation, <i>but not others</i>.<p>Worse still, the direct equivalent to what genes do is that you can&#x27;t even choose an architecture directly, instead you can only contribute to PyTorch. You have to design its API such that naive developers using it stochastically tend towards the desired architecture of their own accord by simply tab-completing often.<p>That&#x27;s essentially what evolution figured out, at least five or six times, but <i>tunable</i>, so that individual species can be attracted to each other but much less to even very closely related species.<p><i>And then</i>, evolution found a way to add a &quot;notch filter&quot; such that despite increased attraction to closely related individuals, most animals (including humans) are <i>repulsed</i> sexually by their parents and siblings.<p>That&#x27;s mind-blowing to me.",

I learned nuclear was heavily-regulated (rightfully so) and costly but the main barriers to new sites were insurance, the huge capital investment, and the very long project cycles. As such, these are just too risky for most business people and investors. Nowadays, even with SMRs, the ROI still doesn&#x27;t make sense given the massive, massive advances in renewables and regional grid storage. Very few Americans want an unproven, fly-by-night startup SMR in their neighborhood or in their county. I&#x27;d be okay with just a few mega reactors in fixed sites in very remote areas that would be heavily defended with perimeter security and anti-aircraft&#x2F;-drone emplacements. I&#x27;m not okay with SMRs on flatbed trailers with minimal security in urban areas.",

We&#x27;ve been operating nuclear reactors for 80 years now, but permanent waste disposal and reactor decommissioning is still in its infancy. The current state-of-the-art is essentially &quot;let it rot in place and hope nothing goes wrong while we figure out a way to deal with it&quot;.

Although fuel would indeed be quite cheap, power still isn&#x27;t going to be free: <i>someone</i> has to pay off the massive construction loans.<p>Consumer power consumption is also a lot more flexible than something like internet. People don&#x27;t suddenly start to consume a lot more data when their internet gets faster - a single person is still only going to watch one Netflix stream at a time, and that&#x27;ll work just as fine on a 100Mbps connection as on a 8Gbps one. And all the equipment is already prepared for the faster connection, so it&#x27;s not like they are saving any money by keeping it slow.<p>But if your power is free, why bother with gas heating? Why go for a heat pump when resistive heating has cheaper equipment? Why bother isolating your home? Why shut off your lights when you leave your home? Making electricity free means we&#x27;ll be using a <i>lot</i> more of it, which means having to build significantly more expensive nuclear power plants.<p>If this was an option, countries with abundant hydro would be providing free power. And they aren&#x27;t.<p>&gt; But instead we have expensive electricity<p>Taking all costs into account, nuclear is currently the most expensive form of generating electricity. While building additional nuclear could get us (mostly) off fossil fuel, it is <i>definitely</i> not going to make your power bill any cheaper.

These 2 factors mean energy is abundant in the state, and necessary in the summer for survival; air conditioning is a necessity due to the extreme temperatures in the summer.<p>The Palo Verde plant was commissioned in the 1980, and provides more power than any other reactor in the US. Since its not located near a body of water, it uses treated wastewater for cooling. It is a Pressurized water reactor design similar to the ones used on Naval vessels, a much safer design than the one used in Chernobyl, and none of which have ever experienced a meltdown or critical failure. Overall, I&#x27;ve never experienced any anxiety regarding the reactor not too far from where I live, it is the least of my concerns.<p>I believe the future will need to be a combination of renewables, to put all our eggs in one basket in foolish.

I also didn&#x27;t elaborate and maybe I should have given the snarky comments I&#x27;m seeing.<p>Actually the amount of power available matters because you are consuming energy in time.   If I have a 1MW plant and a battery, I can generate 1GWh in about 3 weeks.  This seems a little silly though.   A Hyperscale DC campus is ~150MW to 200MW.   If you plot the larger ones, they are almost all near power stations with &gt;1GW capacity (not all).<p>The industry trend is towards building 1GW datacenters.   Last I checked these would consume ~8.7TWh (assuming PUE of 1).   However, the 8.7TWh while relevant is meaningless unless the power to the DC can be 1GW.   Since the plant itself has to generate more than 1GW (the plant has a cap ratio so more than this, plus other demand, etc..) for such a site, then it follows that there are limited number of sites in the US (this is public info see EIA.gov or Wikipedia).<p>Grok3 is already at 140MW (100 days of training ==&gt; 336GWh) at ~10^26 FLOP.   Model FLOP is increasing at ~5x per year so by 2030, we are expecting to be ~10^28 and that would take ~10GW (24PWh). If I am optimistic and say that the efficiency can improve by 1.3x per year, then we still need a very large generating station to meet the demand or we need to distribute among many smaller sites.<p>You can push the numbers around however you like but the conclusion is the same, the timing may be different.<p>There&#x27;s a reason why all the hyperscalers are investing in nuclear, large generating capacity and the highest cap factor of any form of energy.<p>My 2nd comment still stands, and you left unaddressed (remember the forest?)..",

It also has no concept of lock files in at least Maven&#x2F;Gradle, and while resolution dependency in Maven&#x2F;Gradle is supposed to be deterministic, from my experience it is anything but: just a few weeks ago we had a deployment that failed but worked locally&#x2F;CI because of dependency resolution somehow pulled different versions of the same library.<p>Fighting dependency hell because different dependencies pull different version constraints is a pain (all Java&#x2F;JVM projects that I ever worked had some manually pinned dependencies to either fix security issues or to fix broken dependency resolution), and don&#x27;t even get me in the concept of Uber JARs (that we had to use in previous job because it was the only way to ensure that the dependency tree would be solved correctly; yes maybe it was by incompetence of the team that maintained our shared libraries, but the fact that we even got at that situation is unacceptable).<p>Oh, and also Gradle is &quot;so fun&quot;: it is a DSL that has zero discovery (I had IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and I could still not get it to auto-complete 60% of the time), so I would just blindly try to discover what where the inputs of the functions. The documentation didn&#x27;t help because the DSL was so dynamic and every project would use it slightly different, so it was really difficult to discover a way to make it work for that specific project (the examples that I would find would be enough different from my current project that 90% of time it wouldn&#x27;t work without changing something). Python at least has `pyproject.toml` nowadays, and the documentation from PyPA is good enough that you can understand what you want to do after reading it for 10 minutes.",

Let&#x27;s be super rough to get guesstimates. California has an average gas price of $4.83&#x2F;gal[0] and average car is like 24mpg. We&#x27;ll take that at 60mph and assume you&#x27;re driving that (mpg is usually worse in cities). So let&#x27;s say ($4.8&#x2F;g) * (1&#x2F;24 g&#x2F;m) * (60 m&#x2F;h) = 12. So at half capacity the bus is more than half the price. That&#x27;s even before we include things like insurance, maintenance, and anything else (like parking fees). Sure, we&#x27;re super rough, but given how big the difference is I&#x27;d be surprised if refining switched the conclusion.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s extra convenience of cars, but a lot of time we don&#x27;t need that extra convenience. A lot of times we&#x27;re going the same way everyone else is and our convenience becomes inconvenient. There&#x27;s also lots of extra conveniences of public transportation too. If you&#x27;ve experienced good public transit you probably prefer it in most situations.<p>I agree, things need to run all day but I disagree that it costs a lot of money. I think the bigger issue is the negative feedback loop. Public transportation sucks, so no one uses it. -&gt; Public transportation can&#x27;t get more funding because no one uses it. -&gt; No one uses public transportation because it sucks. Unfortunately this is one of those things where &quot;build it and they will come&quot;. It won&#x27;t happen right away, momentum is a bitch, but it can&#x27;t ever happen without making the investment.

Clearly, house prices depend on more factors than size, eg location. Non-normality here could be just an artifact of an underspecified model.",

So in the OP example, we&#x27;re predicting the average price of houses of a given size.<p>The notion of predicting the mean can be extended to other properties of the conditional distribution of the target variable, such as the median or other quantiles [0]. This comes with interesting implications, such as the well-known properties of the median being more robust to outliers than the mean. In fact, the absolute loss function mentioned in the article can be shown to give a conditional median prediction (using the mid-point in case of non-uniqueness). So in the OP example, if the data set is known to contain outliers like properties that have extremely high or low value due to idiosyncratic reasons (e.g. former celebrity homes or contaminated land) then the absolute loss could be a wiser choice than least squares (of course, there are other ways to deal with this as well).<p>Worth mentioning here I think because the OP seems to be holding a particular grudge against the absolute loss function. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it has its virtues and some advantages over least squares. It&#x27;s a trade-off, like so many things.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quantile_regression\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quantile_regression</a>",

Its not wrong to do this, but this is a much more narrow intuition of how regression works!<p>But there is no reason Y needs to follow those two DGPs (The process could be a poisson or a mean reverting process)! \nThere is no reason to believe prima-facie and apriori that the Y|X is following those assumptions. This also gives motivation for using other kinds of models.<p>Its why you test weather those statistical assumptions carefully first using a bit of EDA and from it comes some appreciation and understanding of how linear regression actually works.",

          "text": "Another way to approach the explanation is understanding the data generating process i.e. the statistical assumptions of the process that generates the data. That can go a long way to understanding _analytically_ if linear regression model is a good fit(or what to change in it to make it work). And — arguably more importantly — also a reason why we frame linear regression as a statistical problem instead of an optimization one(or an analytical OLS) in the first place. I would argue understanding it from a statistical standpoint provides much better intuition to a practitioner.<p>The reason to look at statistical assumptions, is because we want to make probabilistic&#x2F;statistical statements about the response variable, like how much is its central tendency and how much it varies as values of X change. The response variable is not easy to measure.<p>Now, one can easily determine, for example using OLS(or gradient descent), the point estimates for parameters of a line that needs to be fit to two variables X and Y, without using any probability or statistical theory. OLS is, in point of fact, just an analytical result and has nothing to do with theory of statistics or inference. The assumptions of simple linear regression are statistical assumptions which can be right or wrong but if they hold, help us in making inferences, like:<p><pre><code>  - Is the response variable varying uniformly over values of another r.v., X(predictors)?\n\n  - Assuming an r.v. Y what model can we make if its expectation is a linear function.\n</code></pre>\nSo why do we make statistical assumptions instead of just point estimates? \nBecause all points of measurements can’t be certain and making those assumptions it is one way of quantifying uncertainty.. Indeed, going through history one finds that Regression&#x27;s use outside experimental data(Galton 1885) was discovered much after least squares(Newton 1795-1809).  The fundamental reasons to <i>understand</i> natural variations in data was the original motivation. In Galton&#x27;s case he wanted to study hereditary traits like wealth over generations as well as others like height, status, intelligence( coincidentally its also  what makes the assumptions of linear regression a good tool for studying this: I think it&#x27;s the idea of Regression to the mean; Very Wealthy or very pool families don&#x27;t remain so over a families generations, they regress towards the mean. So is the case with Societal Class, Intelligence over generations)<p>When you follow this arc of reasoning, you come to the following _statistical_ conditions the data must satisfy for linear assumptions to work(ish):<p>Linear mean function of the response variable conditioned on a value of X<p>E[Y|X=x] = \\beta_0+\\beta_1*x<p>Constant Variance of the response variable conditioned on a value of X<p>Var[Y|X=x] = \\sigma^2 (OR ACTUALLY JUST FINITE ALSO WORKS WELL)",

I was curious about how they worked, and it turned out a few of my less knowledgeable friends had some. The ones I could get my hands on were all @ccsf.edu addresses, with randomly-generated but somewhat plausible-sounding names and surnames (something like &quot;Zyx Ngehirda&quot; or &quot;Anqomi Horezis&quot;, names made up but it&#x27;s roughly what they looked like).<p>From what I could figure out from these, I think you were able to sign up as a CCSF student with very little verification, and as long as you didn&#x27;t take any courses, you didn&#x27;t have to pay. You still got all your accounts set up though, including Google Drive, and you could sell those for a profit.<p>The accounts weren&#x27;t actually as unlimited as the seller claimed, I asked a few months later and they were apparently shut down by that point. One person reported receiving an angry email (on that Google account) notifying them that the account will be removed if they don&#x27;t sign up for a course.<p>This scam must have been heavily automated and very widespread, the accounts were sold on Allegro (Polish Amazon) for $1-$2. It&#x27;s possible other institutions were involved too, the few accounts I knew of were bought at roughly the same time, so they could have come from the same &quot;batch.&quot;",

I was not in CA and I watched dozens of students do this and the college was &quot;blind&quot; to the fraud...very convenient.

The chancellor’s office also considers it fraudulent both to apply to a college with no intention of attending any institution and to enroll in a college with no intention of actually showing up.<p>If these are the criteria, it seems hard to distinguish high school seniors that are going go through the motions, but don&#x27;t actually intend to go to college from people who are trying to pocket financial aid without doing the time in the classroom. (Is it financial aid fraud if you legitimately qualify for the aid, and show up to the classroom with no intent to pass or graduate? If the aid is non-recourse, it might be reasonable as a person to do so)<p>Specifically for California Community Colleges, the stakes are so low for enrollment, I can see a lot of people enrolling just in case, then deciding not to go and forgetting to notify the college. California Community Colleges are an amazing resource, though; I think more people should use them, and more states should build out their community colleges using California as an example.

The biggest technological achievement there was undoubtedly the SPN (previously called Port17&#x2F;Gate17): A privacy network (ie. a layer-5 proxy), fitting in the niche between VPNs and Tor. Impossible to misconfigure, good speeds and way superior privacy to VPNs using onion encryption and decoupled authentication&#x2F;authorization. Funnily enough, this (decoupled auth) is what was later implemented by Apple Private Relay and Google One VPN.<p>SPN worked great for the most part, but scaling was hard. With the decision to make it a layer-5 proxy for decreased metadata and improved privacy, this meant that also traffic and congestion control had to be re-implemented - no easy feat, and still causing issues.<p>Meanwhile, I have followed and read a lot about cjdns and Yggdrasil over the past few years and was intrigued by their ideas how to do networking.<p>After some interesting talks in November 2023, I was at the point where I just wanted to know how far I would get - with all the experience and knowledge I had up to that point - implementing a scalable layer-3 mesh network, that still allowed for some privacy and full security. I spent most evenings of a couple months building it and was surprised how well it went.<p>Sadly, after a decent MVP and a first friend using it in small scale production, I did not have the time to work on it further.<p>But I am currently starting a new project, where I will make good use of it, so it will see quite some more development in the coming years!<p>So, Mycoria works, at least on small scale for now, but is more or less MVP.<p>Thanks for reading, I hope you have fun poking around and trying it out!<p>I am also happy to answer any questions you have here!",

Can definitely see where you&#x27;ve taken lessons learned from cjdns and yggdrassil.<p>I hate to nitpick but this project looks promising enough - and the new project you mentioned interesting enough - that I feel the need to. From your FAQ:<p>&gt; First, there is some structure to the router IPs. While there are special purpose prefixes, most IPs will be in a geo-marked prefix. Every country (+ States in the US) has their own prefix within Mycoria. This means that on the global level, Mycoria routers in the same country share the same prefix. These prefixes are also (tendentially) similar to nearby countries.<p>Second, within a country prefix, Mycoria uses address-distance routing. This means that packets are sent in the direction of the &quot;address-nearest&quot; other router known. While this is not the most efficient way to route packets, it does work quite well with some additional steps - especially if confined to a smaller geographic region, as Mycoria is doing.<p>My commentary: One of the unfortunate lessons we learned from the IPv4 internet and management of IANA IPs by the different RIRs (and the subsequent tagging of IPv4 blocks with geographic information) is that layer-8 folks love the idea of layering policy on top of geographic tags. (E.g.: Maxmind says your address is in Pakistan, and according to Pakistani law content offered by another address is verboten, ergo you are blocked.)<p>Geographic awareness built in to network prefixes may be used against your users in ways that you&#x27;d prefer to avoid. Or perhaps it&#x27;s an acceptable tradeoff for you - it&#x27;s easy to envision scenarios where &#x27;the juice is worth the squeeze&#x27; and users derive enough benefit from geo-aware prefixes to accept the drawbacks. If it&#x27;s the former, I&#x27;d recommend investigating moving from geo-aware prefixes (&quot;I&#x27;m within X miles of other people in this jurisdiction&quot;) to latency-aware prefixes (&quot;I&#x27;m within X ms of other people within this prefix&quot;).<p>(Steelmanning my own recommendation - it&#x27;s possible that anyone trying to implement layer 8 policies on top of geographical-aware prefixes will just willfuly misinterpret latency-aware prefixes as being close enough to them, which would mean a lot of wasted effort for nothing).<p>Anyway, just my two cents. Again, very cool project, looking forward to seeing what you build on top of it!",

To me it&#x27;s not so much about bits and parameters but a more interesting fundamental question of whether pure language itself is enough to encompass and encode higher level thinking.<p>Empirically we observe that an LLM trained purely to predict a next token can do things like solve complex logic puzzles that it has never seen before. Skeptics claim that actually the network has seen at least analogous puzzles before and all it is doing is translating between them. However the novelty of what can be solved is very surprising.<p>Intuitively it makes sense that at some level, that intelligence itself becomes a compression algorithm. For example, you can learn separately how to solve every puzzle ever presented to mankind, but that would take a lot of space. At some point it&#x27;s more efficient to just learn &quot;intelligence&quot; itself and then apply that to the problem of predicting the next token. Once you do that you can stop trying to store an infinite database of parallel heuristics and just focus the parameter space on learning &quot;common heuristics&quot; that apply broadly across the problem space, and then apply that to every problem.<p>The question is, at what parameter count and volume of training data does the situation flip to favoring &quot;learning intelligence&quot; rather than storing redundant domain specialised heuristics?

The basic examples are furnished by scientific or technological calculations: general laws plus initial conditions produce predictions, often only after time-consuming and computer-aided work. One can say that the input contains an implicit knowledge which is thereby made explicit.<p>I have a related idea which I picked up from somewhere which mirrors the above observation.<p>When we see beautiful fractals generated by simple equations and iterative processes,\nwe give importance to only the equations, not to the cartesian grid on which that process\noperates.",

I have a patched Zukitre GTK2-3-4 theme with custom ~&#x2F;.Xdefaults. I nearly don&#x27;t need neither decorations nor a taskbar. Just hit win+w, begin typing, your window it&#x27;s there. Magic. I don&#x27;t even need to use a mouse.<p>OTOH, yes, Gnome&#x27;s blandnes sucks a lot. With Plasma and a bit less, XFCE, you can do far more with a desktop, even Budgie it&#x27;s far better than Gnome3.<p>And I miss tons of GTK2 themes from its era. Bluecurve looked better than everything from today. OSX, Windows, Haiku, whatever. That theme looked colourful, positive and extremely usable, with proper and visible menues, buttons, scrollbars and so. Nowaday both OSX, GTK4 with Adwaita (far less with Zukitre) and Windows are a nightmare on usability.<p>Once you disable the overlay scrollbars under GTK4 and force the GTK theme to Zukitre (once installed) at &#x2F;etc&#x2F;profile.d&#x2F;gtk.sh (a line with &#x27;export GTK_THEME=Zukitre&#x27;), most of the dumb choices from Red Hat&#x2F;FreeDesktop go away for the average Joe user.<p>Zukitre has gray widgets (not full white, damn UI pseudo-designers), usable buttons and proper scrollbars (again, disable the overlay settings for GTK). And, for sure, COLOR CONTRAST, damn it.<p>Mac System 7 did it fine; so did Platinum under Mac OS 8-9. Neutral gray colors, usable widgets. Ditto with OSX, but the stripped bars sucked at first, yet Tiger and Snow Leopard look perfectly usable. The same with Windows 95, even Windows XP and partially 7. Windows 10 is unusable with flat widgets with no contrasts and hints for Windows. Windows 11 it&#x27;s even worse. Current MacOS, with the same overlay scrollbars and lack of contrast it&#x27;s a huge downgrade from Snow Leopard.<p>Even the old Motif&#x2F;FVWM under Unix had a nightmarish usability for the non-CS student, but it had 3D widgets on Motif&#x2F;Athena (Xaw3D) and grabable window <i>borders</i>.\nGo try resizing a window under Gnome3 or Windows 10. Or moving a window at a quick glance.<p>UI designers should stop following trends and just give up on merging tablets and desktops. It doesn&#x27;t work.",

ResEdit will warn you about this too. Make a backup copy, make your changes to the backup copy, then boot from some other blessed System Folder (install CD is fine) and swap them out.<p>The <i>mindset</i> where you can edit anything on everything is what we truly lost when we lost the Classic Mac OS. These themes are merely one embodiment of that mindset. It&#x27;s just Resources all the way down; Any user-facing String, any UI graphics, any icons, any cursors, any sounds, any menus, any window definitions, any dialogs. ResEdit can even be extended to support editing custom (non-Apple) Resource types, to say nothing of the more powerful third-party Resource editors like Resourcerer.<p>Applications&#x27; code even lived in `CODE` resources in the original 68k days before the era of PowerPC and Code Fragment Manager moved that stuff to the Data Fork. A classic 68k-only Application would be a 0-byte file if one copied it to a PC improperly and discarded the Resource Fork.

Second only to all-uppercase for the C preprocessor, where a preprocessor macro can introduce almost arbitrary text.  Using all-uppercase for constants in some language that has constants, however, is an abomination.<p>(My suspicion of why Java did all-caps is that they were developing a language for embedded systems developers who were currently using C and C++, and they wanted to make it superficially look similar, even though it was an entirely different language.  And then, ironically, the language ended up being used mostly by the analogue of a very different developer of the time: corporate internal information systems developers, who, as a field, didn&#x27;t use anything like C.  It&#x27;s too late to save Java, but to all other language and API developers, <i>please stop the insanity of all-caps constants, enum values, etc.</i>  It&#x27;s not the most important thing that needs to jump out from the code above all other things.)",

The communications protocols are just as mysterious, especially on the phone-to-server side.

It’s worth noting Comey reopened an email inquiry four days before the election; this was widely seen as the reason for her loss at the time.<p>Reminder: this was a really big deal to people.<p>Investigation was closed shortly thereafter; he said in interviews at the time he was unhappy with Bill; I vaguely remember a clandestine meeting at a private jet fbo.<p>I’ve always imagined there was a little bit of payback from Obama in this story: the Clintons absolutely did not open up resources for Barack in his first term, and it cost him a lot. My head canon is like: “bury hatchet with Clintons for sec state apptment: fine. Deny Hillary a blackberry: very fine.”",

Modern cryptography is focused on the capabilities of hypothetical computers and making radically more computational power required than is reasonable to expect of current human economies. Backdoors in the codebases for encryption is a fun hypothetical, but the level of scrutiny they are under would require a conspiracy beyond any i could imagine to hide.<p>Eclipse and Sybil attacks were the real threats. Those are Operational attacks, not Signals.<p>Now that I have spend a decade in the security industry in larger corporations. &quot;State Level Actors&quot; are entirely in the threat model. We don&#x27;t talk about it explicitly, but these companies stand to loose globally if any one government compromised them. Government funded actors are assumed to be the primary threat. Supply chain attacks like XZ are the ones that scare us, the ones we might have missed. That came from superiority in operations not technical superiority. They actively pay me and a bunch of other people  a LOT of money to actively detect and prevent issues like this.<p>The other side of the argument is a human organizational one. The story of this decade of military spending is outsourcing. Biden&#x27;s Supply Chain Security EO and the new DoD software procurement requirements are bandaids on gaping wounds.<p>Even with it&#x27;s massive defence spending budget, the TLAs couldn&#x27;t keep up with the industry while also securing all its software. They have 3rd party dependencies too. Assuming that they don&#x27;t just allways directly outsource.<p>And why bother? These companies have the entirety of human communications MITMed. Why bother with a complex secret system when a FISA warrant is cheaper and more efficient. PRISM(For attack) and TOR(For defense) stand out as successes of operational attacks. They don&#x27;t need technological superiority.<p>I fully expect TLAs maintain an android fork and linux forks, but that is opsec for dependency management, not adding special sauce. The industry simply has more resources and more eyes on the problem than the government could ever afford.<p>The last part is simple &quot;Brain Drain&quot;. The people who are really good at this generally don&#x27;t want to work for the government and have done too many drugs to ever get clearance. Unless they have a lot of security engineer salaries in classified budgets they also can&#x27;t afford us. Governments have direct agents that are underpaid and underskilled and they have working relationships with criminal organizations who work deniable offense for them.<p>Opsec is clearly their leverage-able resource, why not lean into it almost exclusively?",

It&#x27;s a key-value store, but you get plenty of great tools for maintaining indices.

It isn&#x27;t comparing apples to oranges to measure the performance of FoundationDB transactions vs an RDBMS.<p>A FoundationDB transaction is a vastly less powerful thing than an RDBMS transaction. In particular, an operation that would be one transaction in an RDBMS must often be split into several transactions in FoundationDB due to its timeout and size limits. An RDBMS allows a client to take thinking time for as long as it needs whilst working on a transaction. FoundationDB stores its undo logs in RAM rather than on disk. This lets them advertise great latencies but is the cause of the five second timeout. They actually advertise this as an &quot;anti feature&quot;:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apple.github.io&#x2F;foundationdb&#x2F;anti-features.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apple.github.io&#x2F;foundationdb&#x2F;anti-features.html</a><p>And KV stores suffer the N+1 query problem once you go over the network: traversing links between objects&#x2F;joins requires round-trips through the client unless you have a very smart record layer and only do simple traversals, which can immediately kill your latency. But in FoundationDB higher latency = smaller numbers of possible operations before your transaction expires and has to be retried from scratch. Thus you can get into a situation where the cluster slowing down due to network congestion can cause death spirals in which transactions start dying because they ran out of time, get retried by the client and this places more load on the cluster which then slows down even more, etc. Whereas in an RDBMS the database slowing down causes backpressure to the clients that is ultimately propagated to the user, avoiding this kind of problem.<p>So... database benchmarks. Complex thing. Be careful out there! See my other comments on this thread for disclosures and more discussion of RDBMS vs FoundationDB.",

The IoRing version can!  But it can&#x27;t do scatter&#x2F;gather AKA vector I&#x2F;O yet!  Which is an essential feature for buffer pool implementation.

Maybe?<p>Another complications is that it really wants to be multithreaded (consuming completions for IOs started in another process requires a lot of hoop jumping, I made it work but...)  This will resolve itself naturally with ongoing work to make PostgreSQL multithreaded.<p>The next problem is that IoRing doesn&#x27;t support sockets!

Part of it is some of the implementation is delegated to user space in glibc as worker threads.  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;671649&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;671649&#x2F;</a> surveys the issues.  I have not done a deep dive into this topic in a long time but as far as I know the situation never greatly improved.  io_uring does not suffer from the problems, although it is a new and non-standard API with associated pros and cons.<p>Thomas Munro has gone into some of the benefits and also gaps of FreeBSD&#x27;s aio(4) vs io_uring here <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.postgresql.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;FreeBSD&#x2F;AIO\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.postgresql.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;FreeBSD&#x2F;AIO</a>.  Notably, because the implementation is in kernel and has received continuous improvement it is gradually removing downsides and there are several users that need it to work well.  This document undersells the problems of ZFS though: the ARC is a necromanced buffer cache which Sun ironically worked very hard to remove (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mcvoy.com&#x2F;lm&#x2F;papers&#x2F;SunOS.vm_arch.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mcvoy.com&#x2F;lm&#x2F;papers&#x2F;SunOS.vm_arch.pdf</a>) and nobody has fixed this in 20 years.  But for UFS or raw block devs or vendor file systems that doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>FreeBSD being a complete &quot;src&quot; tree yields some advantages.  In concrete, there are some in tree consumers like ctld (a CAM&#x2F;iSCSI server) that have been used as vehicles to provide end to end implementation of things like NIC offload of complex protocols that play well with backend block devices such that you can make an offloaded data path that is pumped via asynchronous completion events on both sides (network and block).  A related whitepaper <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chelsio.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;resources&#x2F;T6-100G-DDP-FreeBSD.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chelsio.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;resources&#x2F;T6-100G...</a> but this concept can be extended to iSCSI, NVMeOF etc.  It seems NVMeOF work sponsored by Chelsio is yielding a lot of the finishing touches <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;papers.freebsd.org&#x2F;2023&#x2F;eurobsdcon&#x2F;baldwin-implementing_nvme_over_fabrics_in_freebsd&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;papers.freebsd.org&#x2F;2023&#x2F;eurobsdcon&#x2F;baldwin-implement...</a>.  I believe my colleagues are also improving aio to further optimize the Netflix case of KTLS NIC with data on disk but I am not the right person to extrapolate on that.",

The servers are more expensive too. The storage is more expensive (except for Glacier).

Relatively simple things like &quot;store the graph in an array-oriented way (CSC&#x2F;CSR sparse matrix format or similar)&quot; and &quot;eliminate all memory allocation and pure python code from the Dijkstra search, replace it with simple C code using indices into preallocated arrays&quot; gets you pretty far.  It is possible to get further performance increases by reviewing and tweaking the search code to avoid unnecessary branches,  investigating variants of the priority queue used to maintain partial paths by path distance (i found switching the heap queue from a binary tree to a 4-ary tree gave a 30% reduction in running time), seeing if the nodes of the graph can be reindexed so that nodes with similar indices are spatially similar and more likely to be in cache (another 30% or so reduction in running time from Hilbert curve ordering).  Some of this will be quite problem and data dependent and not necessarily a good tradeoff for other graphs. All up I got around a 30x speedup vs baseline networkx for dijkstra searches to compute path distances to all nodes from a few source nodes on a street network graph with 3.6m nodes &amp; 3.8m edges  (big enough not to fit in L3 cache for the CPU i was running experiments with).",

GLP-1 agonists has helped a lot with both. I eat a strict diet and exercise as often as I can, which is less often than I’d like due to PEM. I think it’s likely that much of uncontrollable weight gain is due to autoimmune issues and GLP-1As do seem to help with that.<p>I started GLP-1As as soon as mainstream adoption started and so I could get safety data to help figure out dosing.

The meta issue is that the human body and its interaction with gut flora and other systems are still somewhat unknown, and we are still simple monkeys using hammers on inputs of the body.<p>Why do we need GLP-1s? Is it because of Western diet? Misfiring reward centers (GLP-1s also appear to quell addictive behavior around alcohol and hard drugs)? Broad antibiotic usage along with more sterile living environments causing misbalanced gut flora (not producing sufficient quantities of natural GLP-1)? The most exciting phrase in science is not &quot;Eureka!&quot; but &quot;That’s funny...&quot;.<p>I thought the long term solution was gene therapy for GLP-1 consumers, but now believe it&#x27;s going to be probiotics that encourage gut flora that excretes sufficient quantities of GLP-1 for the desired metabolic outcome (based on most recent evidence and findings).

It used to be easier back in the time where one income was enough to feed a whole family and the women stayed as housewifes to actually do that, but these times are (thankfully) long gone.<p>Exercising suffers from similar &quot;problems of privilege&quot;. Either you got the money and time to spare to go to a gym, or you got the money and space in your home to install your own gym... or you need actually safe roads where you can walk, jog or bike, and most of the US is so utterly car-dependent that it is outright unsafe to walk.<p>And on top of <i>that</i> you got the whole &quot;living while Black&quot; issue, with egregious instances like a pregnant Black woman arrested for <i>walking her dog</i> [2] - it&#x27;s no surprise that the Black and Indigenous population has noticeably higher rates of diabetes [3] or oral health issues [4].<p>And on top of that, you got the whole issue with educating children about healthy foods, their parents being too poor to afford healthy foods, and that setting up these children for childhood obesity which perpetuates into adulthood. A lot of that is closely correlated with ethnicity and wealth as well.<p>It&#x27;s a systemic issue, an insanely complex one at that, with no easy solution to be found - and certainly not a failure of any individual to stay healthy.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Food_deserts_in_the_United_States\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Food_deserts_in_the_United_Sta...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ca.news.yahoo.com&#x2F;pregnant-black-woman-ticketed-walking-195434227.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ca.news.yahoo.com&#x2F;pregnant-black-woman-ticketed-walk...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthequitytracker.org&#x2F;exploredata?mls=1.diabetes-3.00\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthequitytracker.org&#x2F;exploredata?mls=1.diabetes-3...</a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doh.wa.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;legacy&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;Pubs&#x2F;&#x2F;160-001-OralHlthBurdenDisparities.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doh.wa.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;legacy&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;Pubs...</a>",

In 2021, an estimated 1·00 billion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 0·989–1·01) adult males and 1·11 billion (1·10–1·12) adult females had overweight and obesity. China had the largest population of adults with overweight and obesity (402 million [397–407] individuals), followed by India (180 million [167–194]) and the USA (172 million [169–174]). The highest age-standardised prevalence of overweight and obesity was observed in countries in Oceania and north Africa and the Middle East, with many of these countries reporting prevalence of more than 80% in adults. Compared with 1990, the global prevalence of obesity had increased by 155·1% (149·8–160·3) in males and 104·9% (95% UI 100·9–108·8) in females. The most rapid rise in obesity prevalence was observed in the north Africa and the Middle East super-region, where age-standardised prevalence rates in males more than tripled and in females more than doubled. Assuming the continuation of historical trends, by 2050, we forecast that the total number of adults living with overweight and obesity will reach 3·80 billion (95% UI 3·39–4·04), over half of the likely global adult population at that time. While China, India, and the USA will continue to constitute a large proportion of the global population with overweight and obesity, the number in the sub-Saharan Africa super-region is forecasted to increase by 254·8% (234·4–269·5). In Nigeria specifically, the number of adults with overweight and obesity is forecasted to rise to 141 million (121–162) by 2050, making it the country with the fourth-largest population with overweight and obesity.",

These are not tools that let you &quot;do whatever you want&quot; and still lose weight, but people have been sold the expectation that no habitual change is necessary. Even if your satiety is dialed back, some products are relatively non-satiating yet calorie-dense (e.g. sugary drinks and alcohol, junk food and deep fried foods).<p>You don&#x27;t get to binge for free. In the words of Alan Carr (of &quot;the Easy Way to Stop Smoking&quot; fame), if you view a change in dietary habit as a sacrifice, for instance focusing on healthier food, then you will not succeed.<p>All that being said, it may still be useful. A popular view of pharmaceuticals for primary disorders like for instance insomnia is that they can help &quot;bridge the gap&quot; or get a start and recovery, but that they cannot be relied on in the long-term. Your chemistry adapts. That is similarly the most generous view I have of these products.<p>Anyway, the WW approach has obvious limitations for the same reason low-fat or low-carb does. In WW they use an arbitrary point system to obfuscate restriction, by encouraging protein and low-calorie density foods. Some foods are 0-1 in points (e.g. 0% cottage cheese), some are high regardless of how healthy they are (avocado). You can easily see the problem with this: you quickly hit a wall where you aren&#x27;t automatically reducing calorie intake by mere virtue of what you are eating. The same thing happens with low-carb and low-fat: what are you going to do once you&#x27;ve cut out all fat and all carbs? Eat negative-carbs?<p>For sustainable WL of a large amount of weight, there is no way around counting. You cannot &quot;intuitively&quot; do it. And here it&#x27;s important to stress that there&#x27;s a major difference between avoiding weight-gain, and losing weight. If you&#x27;re a person of average weight, you don&#x27;t need to worry about counting jack if you simply have good eating habits. This is not enough when it comes to caloric restriction.<p>edit: re reduced cravings, some don&#x27;t just overeat from physical cravings, but for emotional satisfaction. A binge session on comfort food is not about hunger. This is something to be addressed through therapy.",

These drugs really do help some special cases, I don&#x27;t deny that, but the fact the broad population have access to these drugs is not a natural state. We have no idea what the long-term effects will be. Long-term artifically induced effects of illness will eventually cause problems- erosive esophagitis and hemorrhoids are two examples- that have long-term health implications. Better to bite the bullet, if you have the ability, simply reduce your input, focus on foods that last longer in the digestive tract  (whole plant foods), giving us fewer or more moderate glucose spikes, less craving and hunger later.

Since I started using LLMs a bit more, the killer step for me was to set up API access to a variety of providers (Mistral, Anthropic, Gemini, OpenAI), and use a unified client to access them.

Switch models on the fly, switch between one-shot and session mode, log everything locally for later access, and ask casual questions with a single quick command.<p>I <i>think</i> all providers guarantee that they will not use your API inputs for training, it&#x27;s meant as the pro version after all.<p>Plus it&#x27;s dirt cheap, I query them several times per day, with access to high end thinking models, and pay just a few € per month.",

In a case like that you can imagine a service could have either an in-process implementation or an out-of-process implementation (e.g. via a web endpoint or some RPC.)  Frameworks like that normally are thinking at the level of &quot;let&#x27;s initialize one application in one address space at a time&quot; but it would be nice to see something oriented towards managing applications that live in various address spaces.<p>Trouble is that some people get this squee when they hear they can use JDK 9 for this project and JDK 10 for another project and JDK 11 for another project and they&#x27;d rather die than eschew the badly broken Python 3.5 for something better.  If you standardized <i>absolutely everything</i> I think you could be highly productive with microservices because you wouldn&#x27;t have to face gear switching or deal with teams who just don&#x27;t know that XML serialization worked completely differently in JDK 7 vs JDK 8 thus the services they make don&#x27;t quite communicate properly, etc.",

The main benefit is letting small groups of people work independently without stepping on each other’s toes.

Learning the diplomatic way to say “mind your own business” was more important than any technical skills for getting code merged.",

You’re paying the price without getting the benefit: duplicated infra, fragile local setups, and slow iteration. For example, Segment eventually reversed their microservice split for this exact reason — too much cost, not enough value.<p>Basically this. Microservices are a design pattern for organisations as opposed to technology. Sounds wrong but the technology change should follow the organisational breakout into multiple teams delivering separate products or features. And this isn&#x27;t a first step. You&#x27;ll have a monolith, it might break out into frontend, backend and a separate service for async background jobs e.g pdf creation is often a background task because of how long it takes to produce. Anyway after that you might end up with more services and then you have this sprawl of things where you start to think about standardisation, architecture patterns, etc. Before that it&#x27;s a death sentence and if your business survives I&#x27;d argue it didn&#x27;t because of microservices but inspite of them.

But on the flip side, introducing those heavier-weight boundaries on to yourself, internal to a team, can be very counterproductive.<p>I can&#x27;t prove this scales up forever but I&#x27;ve been very happy with making sure that things are carefully abstracted out with dependency injection for anything that makes sense for it to be dependency-injected, and using module boundaries internally to a system as something very analogous to microservices, except that it doesn&#x27;t go over a network. This goes especially well with using actors, even in a non-actor-focused language, because actors almost automatically have that clean boundary between them and the rest of the world, traversed by a clean concept of messages. This is sometimes called the Modular Monolith.<p>Done properly, should you later realize something needs to be a microservice, you get clean borders to cut along and clean places to deal with the consquences of turning it into a network service. It isn&#x27;t perfect but it&#x27;s a rather nice cost&#x2F;benefit tradeoff. I&#x27;ve cut out, oh, 3 or 4 microservices out of monoliths in the past 5 years or so.

It also adds enough intentional friction that we don&#x27;t accidentally put logic where it doesn&#x27;t belong as part of the user authentication process. It has helped keep the code focused on only primary concerns.<p>That said, you can&#x27;t apply any of these patterns blindly, as is so often the case. A good technical leader should push back when the benefits don&#x27;t actually exist.

You could have the benefit of good design without all the architectural and operational challenges of microservices. Maybe some people succeed at this. But in practice I&#x27;ve never seen it. I&#x27;ve seen people handle the challenges of microservices successfully, and I&#x27;ve never seen a monolith that wasn&#x27;t an incoherent mess internally.<p>This is just my experience, one person&#x27;s observations offered for what they&#x27;re worth.<p>In practice, in the context of microservices, I&#x27;ve seen an entire team work together for two weeks to break down a problem coherently, holding off on starting implementation because they knew the design wasn&#x27;t good enough and it was worth the time to get it right. I&#x27;ve seen people escalate issues with others&#x27; designs because they saw a risk and wanted to address it.<p>In the context of monoliths, I&#x27;ve never seen someone delay implementation so much as a day because they knew the design was half-baked. I rarely see anyone ask for design feedback or design anything as a team until they&#x27;ve screwed something up so badly that it can&#x27;t be avoided. People sometimes make major design decisions in a split second while coding. What kind of self-respecting senior developer would spend a week getting input on an internal code API before starting to implement? People sometimes aren&#x27;t even aware that the code they wrote that morning has implications for code that will be written later.<p>Theoretically this is okay because refactoring is easy in a monolith. Right? ... It is, right?<p>I&#x27;m basically sold on microservices because I know how to get developers to take design seriously when it&#x27;s a bunch of services talking to each other via REST or grpc, and I don&#x27;t know how to get them to take the internal design of a monolith seriously.",

Making a call across the network might as well take an eternity by comparison to a local method. Arguments can be made that the latency can be &quot;hidden&quot;, but this is generally only true for the more trivial kinds of problems. For many practical businesses, you are typically in a strictly serialized domain which means that you are going to be forced to endure every microsecond of delay. Assuming that a transaction was not in conflict doesn&#x27;t work at the bank. You need to be sure every time before the caller is allowed to proceed.<p>The tighter the latency domain, the less you need to think about performance.

Whatever the reason, it can kill velocity during the transition. In my experience, if this is being done to support becoming multi-product, this loss in velocity comes at the worst time and can sink even very component teams.<p>As an industry, the gap between what makes sense for startups and what makes sense for scale <i>can</i> be a huge chasm. To be clear, I don&#x27;t think it means you should invest in micro-services on the off-chance you need to hit scale (which I think is where <i>many</i> convince themselves of) nor does it mean that you should always head to microservices even when you hit those forcing functions (scaling monoliths is possible!)<p>That said, modularity, flexibility, and easy evolution are super important as companies grow and I do really think the next generation of tools and platforms will be benefit to better suiting themselves to evolution and flexibility than they do today. One idea I have thought for some time is platforms that &quot;feel&quot; like a monolith, but are 1) more concrete in building firmer interfaces between subsystems and 2) have flexibility in how calls happen between these interfaces (imagine being able to run a subsystem embedded or transparently to move calls over an RPC interface). Certainly that is &quot;possible&quot; with well structured code in platforms today... but it isn&#x27;t always natural.<p>I am not sure the answer, but I really hope the next 10 years of my career has less massive chasms crossed via huge multi-year painful efforts and more cautious, careful evolution enabled by well considered tool and platforms.",

The advice should be &quot;just do the scrappy thing&quot;.<p>This distinction is important. Sometimes, creating a separate service is the scrappy thing to do, sometimes creating a monolith is. Sometimes not creating anything is the way to go.<p>Let&#x27;s consider a simple example: adding a queue poller. Let&#x27;s say you need to add some kind of asynchronous processing to your system. Maybe you need to upload data from customer S3 buckets, or you need to send emails or notifications, or some other thing you need to &quot;process offline&quot;.<p>You could add this to your monolith, by adding some sort of background pollers that read an SQS queue, or a table in your database, then do something.<p>But that&#x27;s actually pretty complicated, because now you have to worry about how much capacity to allocate to processing your service API and how much capacity to allocate to your pollers, and you have scale them all up at the same time. If you need more polling, you need more api servers. It become a giant pain really quickly.<p>It&#x27;s much simpler to just separate them then it is to try to figure out how to jam them together.<p>Even better though, is to not write a queue poller at all. \nYou should just write a Lambada and point it at your queue.<p>This is particularly true if you are me, because I wrote the Lambda Queue Poller, it works great, and I have no real reason to want to write it a second time. And I don&#x27;t even have to maintain it anymore because I haven&#x27;t worked at AWS since 2016. You should do this to, because my poller is pretty good, and you don&#x27;t need to write one, and some other schmuck is on the hook for on-call.<p>Also you don&#x27;t really need to think about how to scale at all, because Lambda will do it for you.<p>Sure, at some point, using Lambda will be less cost effective than standing up your own infra, but you can worry about that much, much, much later. And chances are there will be other growth opportunities that are much more lucrative than optimizing your computer bill.<p>There are other reasons why it might be simpler to split things. Putting your control plane and your data plane together just seems like a head ache waiting to happen.<p>If you have things that happen every now and then (&quot;CreateUser&quot;, &quot;CreateAccount&quot;, etc) and things that happen all the time (&quot;CaptureCustomerClick&quot;, or &quot;UpdateDoorDashDriverLocation&quot;, etc) you probably want to separate those. Trying to keep them together will just end up causing your pain.<p>I do agree, however, that having a &quot;Users&quot; service and an &quot;AccountService&quot; and a &quot;FooService&quot; and &quot;BarService&quot; or whatever kind of domain driven nonsense you can think of is a bad idea.<p>Those things are likely to cause pain and high change correlations, and lead to a distributed monolith.<p>I think the advice shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;Use a Monolith&quot;, but instead should be &quot;Be Scrappy&quot;. You shouldn&#x27;t create services without good reason (and &quot;domain driven design&quot; is not a good reason). But you also shouldn&#x27;t &quot;jam things together into a monolith&quot; when there&#x27;s a good reason not to. N sets of crud objects that are highly related to each other and change in correlated ways don&#x27;t belong in different services. But things that work fundamentally differently (a queue poller, a control-plane crud system, the graph layer for grocery delivery, an llm, a relational database) should be in different services.<p>This should also be coupled with &quot;don&#x27;t deploy stuff you don&#x27;t need&quot;. Managing your own database is waaaaaaay more work that just using Dynamo DB or DSQL or Big Table or whatever....<p>So, &quot;don&#x27;t use domain driven design&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t create services you don&#x27;t need&quot; is great advice.

Each microservice needs to do that and do integration testing with every service they interact with. If you can&#x27;t deploy a microservice without also updating all its dependencies then you don&#x27;t have an independent service at all. You just have a more complicated deployment with more bugs.<p>The real problem you&#x27;re trying to solve is deployment. If a given service takes 10 minutes to restart, then you have a problem. Ideally that should be seconds. But more ideally, you should be able to drain traffic from it then replace it however long it takes and then slowly roll it out checking for canary changes. Even more ideally, this should be largely automated.<p>Another factor: build times. If a service takes an hour to compile, that&#x27;s going to be a huge impediment to development speed. What you need is a build system that caches hermetic artifacts so this rarely happens.<p>With all that above, you end up with what Google has: distributed builds, automated deployment and large, monolithic services.",

I&#x27;m happy to see the editor receive the success it deserves, because the team has poured so much world-class engineering work into it.<p>I worked with Antonio on prototyping the extensions system[0]. In other words, Antonio got to stress test the pair programming collaboration tech while I ran around in a little corner of the zed codebase and asked a billion questions. While working on zed, Antonio taught me how to talk about code and make changes purposefully. I learned that the best solution is the one that shows the reader how it was derived. It was a great summer, as far as summers go!<p>I&#x27;m glad the editor is open source and that people are willing to pay for well-engineered AI integrations; I think originally, before AI had taken off, the business model for zed was something along the lines of a per-seat model for teams that used collaborative features. I still use zed daily and I hope the team can keep working on it for a long time.<p>[0]: Extensions were originally written in Lua, which didn&#x27;t have the properties we wanted, so we moved to Wasm, which is fast + sandboxed + cross-language. After I left, it looks like Max and Marshall picked up the work and moved from the original serde+bincode ABI to Wasm interface types, which makes me happy: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zed.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;zed-decoded-extensions\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zed.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;zed-decoded-extensions</a>.

Zed <i>almost</i> gets there and it&#x27;s maddening to me that they don&#x27;t embrace it fully. I think once I show them what the stakes of the game are they have the engineering talent to catch up.<p>The main reason it hasn&#x27;t been done is that we&#x27;re still all basically writing code on paper. All of the most modern tools that people are using, they&#x27;re still basically just digitizations of punchcard programming. If you dig down through all the layers of abstractions at the very bottom is line and column, that telltale hint of paper&#x27;s two-dimensionality. And because line and column get baked into every integration surface, the limitations of IDEs are the limitations of paper. When you frame the task of programming as &quot;write a huge amount of text out on paper&quot; it&#x27;s no wonder that people turn to LLMs to do it.<p>For the integration layer using the tree as the primary means you get to stop worrying about a valid tree layer blinking into and out of existence constantly, which is conceptually what happens when someone types code syntax in left to right. They put an opening brace in, then later a closing brace. In between a valid tree representation has ceased to exist.",

Zed itself is perfect evidence of that -- they built an AI integration and then basically had to throw it away and rebuild it because the consensus best practice design changed. The Helix maintainers don&#x27;t have time for that kind of churn and aren&#x27;t trying to keep up with the hype cycle.

Vulkan can only run on the primary rendering GPU, but it doesn&#x27;t always pick that one, and doesn&#x27;t support trying any others after the first one or picks (it seems), so it just falls back to emulated.<p>For reference, I had to spend 4 days getting Zed to install as part of a Nix home-manager config with nixGL because out of the box it failed to use the GPU on 2 of 3 systems. But after forcing it to use the right GPU with a wrapper that had Vulkan support (a nixGL wrapper) all 3 systems worked fine (so it&#x27;s a Zed assumption&#x2F;bug problem).<p>Also, the fact that Zed without the Vulkan supported hardware rendering is unusably slow is a big problem. It&#x27;s far slower than anything else on the system and cranks the CPU to 100 with its &quot;emulated GPU&quot; workaround. That&#x27;s not acceptable, they really need to get at least basic performance for the seeming majority of target systems that don&#x27;t&#x2F;can&#x27;t meet the hardware rendering needs.",

While Zed has that particular feature right out of the box, there&#x27;s no ability to add features like that via extensions in Zed.  \nAlso, Zed doesn&#x27;t even seem to have the concept of per-buffer settings or &quot;effective&quot; settings that differ from what&#x27;s on disk. It&#x27;s why you can&#x27;t set tabs vs spaces for indentation in a single buffer, you can only set it globally (for example). That&#x27;s probably why they don&#x27;t allow extensions that do things like add predefined key maps, or associate new files with a language (without defining a new grammar), or apply a pre-defined set of settings automatically (E.g. autodetect indentation type? Vim&#x2F;Emacs modeline parsing?). Almost all of even the simplest VSCode, Emacs, and Vim&#x2F;Neovim extensions&#x2F;packages&#x2F;plugins make use of this concept, which is why it&#x27;s wild Zed doesn&#x27;t even (seemingly) have the concept of it, let alone allowing extensions to use it.<p>In fact, I&#x27;d argue Zed doesn&#x27;t actually have an extension system at all. It has a completion system (LSP servers), a language addition system (tree sitter grammar and&#x2F;or LSP server), and a themeing system. It just combines all three into a single list it somewhat misleadingly calls &quot;extensions&quot;. But it&#x27;s missing the ability for &quot;extensions&quot; to do any of the most basic things every other tool assumes is table stakes for an extension system.",

But there were dozens and dozens of pages to cover the API surface, and I decided that while this might work, it wasn&#x27;t a process I would ever be happy repeating.<p>So, I went looking for some kind of Crates.io or Rust MCP. Pretty early looking effort, but I found cratedocs-mcp. It can search crates, lookup docs for crates,lookup specific members in crates; that seems like maybe it might be sufficient, maybe it might help.

For anything beyond simple syntax highlighting, you need to be able to context parse all the multi-file cross references and inputs that can only come from building the entire project with preprocessing and then parsing the LLM (the intermediate syntax, not the AI thing). For most projects that are nontrivial, a compilation cycle can be 10 minutes to 4+ hours, and requires the specific settings you want to build with. Breaking them down to per-file also doesn&#x27;t work because you&#x27;d have to do a complete dry run execution of the build system just to get the specific toolchain build settings for each file. And remember there are dozens of possible build tools that your tool has to emulate a dry run of now.<p>Most tools I&#x27;ve seen can only make a half attempt at C&#x2F;C++ as a result, and usually the solutions scale incredibly poorly. The basic CTags for example, that just indexes symbols in your project source code, easily generates a &gt;4 GB database file on something like a Yocto build. Which is why they invented Exuberant CTags that uses a binary database to try and speed it up. But even still, you&#x27;re getting almost no useful context from results, and it has a very long lag in response when you do ask something.<p>The AI LLM support for C and C++ seems able to make guesses with the partial info that&#x27;s available to them, whether its only the one file of context or the whole project (very uncommon), but it has the lowest successful output rate of any context helper I&#x27;ve ever used.",

Love it.<p>I switched to cursor earlier this year to try out LLM assisted development and realised how much I now despise vscode. It’s slow, memory hungry, and just doesn’t work as well (and in a keyboard centric way) as Zed.<p>Then a couple of weeks ago, I switched back to Zed, using the agents beta. AI in Zed doesn’t feel quite as polished as cursor (at least, edit predictions don’t feel as good or fast), but the agent mode works pretty well now. I still use cursor a little because anything that isn’t vscode or pycharm has imho a pretty bad Python LSP experience (those two do better because they use proprietary LSP’s), but I’m slowly migrating to full stack typescript (and some Gleam), so hope to fully ditch cursor in favour of Zed soon.",

Zed has been working great for me for ~1.5 years while I ignored its AI features (I only started using Zed&#x27;s AI features in the past 2 weeks). Vim keybindings are better IMHO than every other non-vim editor and the LSP&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used (typescript, clangd, gleam) have worked perfectly.<p>2. The edit prediction feature is almost there. I do still prefer Cursor for this, but its not so far ahead that I feel like I want to use Cursor and personally I find Zed to be a much more pleasant editor to use than vscode.<p>3. When you switch the agent panel from &quot;write&quot; to &quot;ask&quot; mode, its basically that, no?<p>I&#x27;m not into vide coding at all, I think AI code is still 90% trash, but I do find it useful for certain tasks, repetitive edits, and boilerplate, or just for generating a first pass at a React UI while I do the logic. For this, Zed&#x27;s agent feature has worked very well and I quite like the &quot;follow mode&quot; as a way to see what the AI is changing so I can build a better mental model of the changes I&#x27;m about to review.<p>I do wish there was a bit more focus on some core editor features: ligatures still don&#x27;t fully work on Linux; why can&#x27;t I pop the agent panel (or any other panel for that matter) into the center editor region, or have more than one panel docked side by side on one of the screen sides? But overall, I largely have the opposite opinion and experience from you. Most of my complaints from last year have been solved (various vim compatibility things), or are in progress (debugger support is on the way).",

And many of his appearances went far beyond the role of CEO to include playing host, product demonstrator and marketing spokesperson.<p>He clearly had no problem with representing the company and actively promoting Disney theme parks, movies and products with his image. Even while he was alive Disney Corp sold high-end memorabilia like large framed pictures of Walt working at his drawing board and including his distinctive signature. So he not only promoted products but turned himself into a revenue generating product. In some sense, he made himself a mascot for his company as much as Mickey Mouse and this was clearly by design. To me that&#x27;s different than a CEO who mostly limited his public exposure to the usual earnings calls and shareholder&#x27;s meetings.",

People will buy it if it&#x27;s a necessary item. The tariff doesn&#x27;t give them a reason to adjust the price up or down or do anything different at all. They sell to their U.S. wholesale customer at the same price, that wholesale customer pays the tariff, and then the wholesale customer either passes the tariff through to the retail customer or charges multiples to maintain the same profit margin percentage.<p>In the absence of IP protections, it would hurt the countries with the highest tariffs on their products because there would be an incentive to produce an equivalent product domestically or source it from another country whose products are taxed at a lower rate. In practice, it still doesn&#x27;t work out to impose broad tariffs because no one has a fully domestic supply chain. It really only makes sense to tariff very specific items in new-ish markets where you have a foreign player whose government is subsidizing production, e.g. Chinese EV&#x27;s, Chinese EV batteries, solar panels, etc.",

In the last ~15 years, they pick and choose.<p>They seem to ignore China stuff since it&#x27;s mostly low value and have a sharp eye to spot stuff from, e.g. Japan that&#x27;s probably higher value.<p>No idea how Aliexpress and others that use gig workers for last-mile delivery do it.

They&#x27;ll own the phone in 4 years instead of 2, but they probably would have upgraded to a new phone in 2 years and would have been paying the $200&#x2F;mo. anyway.<p>Timing is good for phone makers here honestly because phone innovation is slowing down so high prices for the same stuff can be blamed on tarriffs instead of lack of innovation.<p>The second most expensive electronics would be game systems, and that&#x27;ll be painful, but I do wonder if e.g. Nintendo would pair with cellular companies and do installment plans like phones, and&#x2F;or if PS&#x2F;Xbox would try to do something similar with ISPs (e.g. AT&amp;T Gamer Deal) or rent their consoles instead of selling them.<p>Gamer PCs are gonna take a serious hit though, and the price of individual games is certain to increase.",

          "text": "I recently got hit with $700 of tariffs on electronics, just as a consumer.  It&#x27;s definitely real and very annoying -- and as a consumer, visibility into it is extremely low, which makes it even worse.<p>Long story incoming (blog post candidate? Hmm...)<p>Pimoroni is a fantastic supplier of hobby electronics stuff -- they&#x27;re like Adafruit, but in the UK.  Adafruit actually sells a fair amount of their stuff, but not everything.  So I occasionally order directly from them (often adding in some items that are frequently out of stock at Adafruit, such as Pi 5 chargers).<p>I placed a big order right after the first tariffs were announced but before they went into effect. Pimoroni was having a big sale at the time, so I loaded up, thinking it&#x27;d be the last pre-tariff order I made.  I elected to pay extra (not much) for UPS, since I generally trust them the most out of the shipping carriers who deliver to me (in Southern NH, right by the freight hub of MHT).<p>After my package arrived from overseas, it was &quot;stuck&quot; in a warehouse in a port city for several days.  The UPS website claimed &quot;your package is being cleared, but we have all the info we need so just sit tight&quot;... After a few days of this, I tried calling up.  After fighting with the phone tree robot (one of the few for which swearing didn&#x27;t seem to get me a human, strangely), the front-line support finally told me that it was actually held up in customs awaiting more information.  The support rep just told me to send an invoice and hung up.<p>That was the first strange flag -- sellers always include invoices on their packages, so why do they need me to send one?  I hunted around for a more effective phone number -- a difficult task -- and eventually found the UPS small business customs office line (had to involve ChatGPT to help find the number, Google being useless now).  After calling up, I was redirected a few times and finally got ahold of someone who actually was able to investigate for me.  He found out that it was being held because US customs had classified some items (incorrectly) as needing additional forms (more on that below), and that I also would have to pay serious tariffs but only after the additional forms were filed.<p>The helpful UPS guy (who, it turns out, doesn&#x27;t even work in that department, but had been pulled in to help because the tariff changes were causing a lot of strife) was able to link me to a website with more information and a place to upload forms and track info.  The forms needed were: a vehicle import form -- apparently the US government thinks any pump being imported must be a vehicle part, even a tiny fountain pump for plant watering -- and a pesticide import form -- apparently RGB LED matrices are considered pesticides, because they seem similar to UV lamps I guess... And there was no way to reclassify the items (not sure if that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m just a lowly consumer or what).<p>I sent this stuff over to Pimoroni, and the folks there were equally confused.  But they eventually figured out how to fill out the forms and sent them back, and I uploaded them.  UPS sent them along and satisfied the government, and my package was released to UPS.  But by this time, the tariffs were in effect.  And even though I had ordered from the UK, most of the electronics had been manufactured in China, and some contained steel made in Mexico, so the tariffs apparently applied.<p>On top of the tariffs, UPS was going to charge me excessive warehousing fees for the package being held up!  Fortunately, my helpful UPS contact was able to get approval to get those reversed, since I was never informed that the package needed more info.<p>However, the story doesn&#x27;t end here!  The package was finally sent on its way and my friendly UPS driver showed up at my door with it a few days later, along with the bill.  Unfortunately, it was the full bill including the warehousing fees!  I had to call up a different UPS line (invoicing) and have them make sure the warehousing fees were taken off, then specifically have them call the local UPS distribution center to have them update it.  This happened, and the next day the driver showed up...with the same bill.<p>Turns out UPS systems are poorly set up.  The driver called up the distribution center and verbally confirmed the updated price, but his device would NOT accept anything other than the full amount listed, with no overrides possible.  We worked it out, though: I gave him a check for the correct amount, and he gave me the package but did not mark it delivered.  He returned to the distribution center, and from there they must have figured out how to override it, because finally it was marked as paid and delivered and everything was solved.<p>So I got my electronics.  But the cost was $700 in tariffs due to manufacturing country (not even final manufacturing country, nor shipper country) and including vehicle and pesticide taxes for items that were not vehicles or pesticides.  On a $1900 order.  Plus nearly a month of time and countless hours wasted on the phone.<p>Suffice to say the next time I went looking for a part and saw that it was shipping from outside the US, I didn&#x27;t buy it.  So, intended effect of the tariffs, I guess?  Though I couldn&#x27;t just order from the US instead, because it wasn&#x27;t available, so I just didn&#x27;t order anything.  Hooray.<p>It was shocking to see just how little information pretty much everyone had in this process (myself included), the complete lack of ability to correct blatant errors, and the &quot;delay and rack up more $&quot; strategies that seemed to be occurring.<p>Wrt the post here: I&#x27;m sad to see Adafruit get hit by this bill, and I&#x27;m sure their prices are going to go up as a result, but I&#x27;m definitely going to continue purchasing from them, and I hope they continue to stock items from elsewhere (including Pimoroni).  And I hope to one day feel comfortable ordering directly from Pimoroni again...",

But governments allocate resources <i>democratically</i> exactly because we do not always want to allocate resources efficiently with respect to making money.<p>Whether it &quot;makes sense&quot; or not, most people believe there is more to life than the efficient allocation of resources and thus it might be a reasonable opinion that making 100,000 people suddenly unemployed is bad. I doubt seriously that the OP believes having 100,000 people working <i>indefinitely</i> when the labor can be done more efficiently by machines is good.

I don&#x27;t want to get overconfident here, but this claim feels off-base.<p>Insurance isn&#x27;t like a widget. People have actual legal rights that insurers must service. This involves processing clerks, adjusters, examiners, underwriters, etc. Which then requires actual humans, because AI with the pinpoint accuracy needed for these legally binding, high-stakes decisions aren&#x27;t here yet.<p>E.g., issuing and continuing disability policies: Sifting through medical records, calling and emailing claimants and external doctors, constant follow-ups about their life and status. Sure, automate parts of it, but what happens when your AI:<p>a. incorrectly approves someone, then you need to kick them off the policy later?<p>b. incorrectly denies someone initial or continuing coverage?<p>Both scenarios almost guarantee legal action—multiple appeals, attorneys getting involved—especially when it&#x27;s a denial of ongoing benefits.<p>And that&#x27;s just scratching the surface.

However Crypto, which has liquidity issues and is heavily scammed&#x2F;stolen would benefit far more than the users of business. The holdings would stay for decades, allowing arbitrage of the main company with user investments. If there is a leak or a collapse of the crypto, the customers won’t know it until they can’t get their funds back, but since AI is handling the claims, they may never even find out the real reason they can’t get their money back. And since it’s life insurance, the buyer might never find out, while their descendants or loved ones may not know how to deal with it or be plenty confused by the lack of customer service.

I had just passed their test and was going through the case study interview and I got paired with a PhD in physics from MIT.  I think the study was something about cognac sales and I just got disgusted with the waste of training and talent, and after I got home from the airport that evening I pulled out of the interview process even though I had no other employment options at the time.<p>Somewhat ironically, over the past 20 years I’ve come to reject PhD-type career tracks after seeing how much PhD overproduction there is and how my older colleagues only had a BS or MS.  These days, I yearn to leave my Big Tech job to start a “boring” business.  Right now I’m taking Accounting 101 at a local university to understand business financials better.",

First as you said, most consultants are not real &quot;leaders&quot; or &quot;tech leaders&quot; and when you start to get experience, you leave consulting or you raise the hierarchical ladder to become a more senior manager, that spend more time finding contracts, negotiating, dealing with the customer proposals and renewal than doing the actual job.<p>In the end, you have juniors that are doing the tasks pretending to be sector experts or like the guy in the article, you are propulsed &quot;CEO&quot; of the big entity of a big corp just after 4 or 5 years of basic consultant experience, not even having worked in real non-conducting job.<p>In the end, when you buy a mission to such a firm, most of the cost goes to structural costs and daily rate of a chain of useless parasitic executives like directors, executive partners, vice president, that will spend 10 minutes per month reviewing slides on the project. The consulting doing the job will be paid at most the double of what a good freelance can expect.<p>And regarding the spirit, the fun thing is that even when you do bad or evilish things, there is kind of a mental block brain process that makes you truly believe that you are doing an useful and much needed work. Despite it not the case.<p>In my own case, often I had this bad feeling deep in. A background that a customer that we were negotiating a mission for millions, could have just hired a decent developer for just a few thousands euros and have quite profited from a most good and successful system.<p>But like, in Matrix, when you are inside the system, it is hard to consider things outside the box.<p>In the same way that again in the example of the blog post, I&#x27;m quite sure that the big company would been able to find hundreds of existing employees that would have fitted the bill well and better for a lot cheaper.",

The reason McKinsey is hired is to avoid internal conflicts over which manager takes the reigns. I doubt McKinsey is providing solutions to these industries (as in, introducing a product that was not pitched internally by someone already. In fact, in most cases, a manager will pitch the solution and McKinsey&#x27;s job is purely finding the right managers to leave this internal &quot;startup&quot; to). Should that be the case, I would love to be proven wrong. However, every consultant I had met is no engineer or tech leader. They are merely consultants, restructuring the answers in ways that avoid conflicts within established giants. Most of them are Ivy League graduates that never worked in the technical field (got hired at Bain or McKinsey fresh out of school). Often we would make up stacks to demonstrate how ignorant they can be of technology. Managers and business people love McKinsey. As an engineer, I have not met any tech founder or technical engineer that esteemed the field (just listen to Steve Jobs&#x27; opinion on consulting). I attribute the mess that Google is under Sundar to McKinsey (not even mentioning the Opioid crisis where their hands are stained too). The redeeming factor is the author describes them as the enemy and is at least honest about his reasons for joining (stability and established resume name)",

(FWIW JetBrains is quite good generating revenue, and I&#x27;m fairly certain their revenue dwarfs that of Cursor and Windsurf.)<p>- Whoever is paying you is your customer, no matter what alternative word we use for it. If you&#x27;re an employee, your customer is your &quot;employer.&quot; If you&#x27;re being acquired, your customer is your &quot;acquirer.&quot;<p>- In most cases, acquirers are playing the role of investor. Investors value returns. If you want to provide value for an acquirer, then, you need to convince them of the future value of your business should it be acquired. That&#x27;s usually best done through growth trajectories.<p>- It&#x27;s perfectly valid to continue generating revenue year after year without being acquired for eye-watering sums. It&#x27;s a waste of your emotional energy to become jealous or indignant when others get acquired or succeed with less work. Good for them, just keep doing you.

For example, runtime-compiled regex patterns or any other feature which relies on emitting IL at runtime and creating new members or even assembles and then loading them. Similar applies to compiled expression trees - they are supported in NativeAOT but in the form of falling back onto interpreting them, which has worse performance. Or unbound reflection with patterns that cannot be statically proven and&#x2F;or analyzed.<p>Reflection analysis can (and will) be improved but there are hard constraints - a correctly working expression like &#x27;someAssembly.GetType(Console.ReadLine())&#x27; by definition would have to root (and force compilation for) every type in the assembly, which is highly undesirable or even sometimes unfeasible for AOT compilation. And there is a lot of code which does exactly this.<p>The main challenge are packages and frameworks. ASP.NET Core is largely compatible (via minimal API) and so is AvaloniaUI, EF Core has <i>some</i> compatibility assurances and DapperAOT is tailor-made as the name implies, serialization is also a solved problem although you may need to use a different API.<p>At the end of the day, NativeAOT is not something &quot;to be fully migrated to&quot; because it has fundamental restrictions (some of which also affect other languages like Rust or Go) and having JIT around is a feature for patterns which specifically exploit it but is also a performance optimization (DynamicPGO, better instruction selection especially around SIMD paths, turning static readonly&#x27;s into JIT constants and apply subsequent optimizations on top of that, this is what makes C# port of Mimalloc so good as it elides dead code with assertions impossible to remove dynamically in C&#x2F;C++). NativeAOT has its own optimizations, and it will continue to diverge with JIT (e.g. there&#x27;s a toggle in .NET compiler to repeat some optimization phases, usually it&#x27;s too expensive for JIT but for AOT it&#x27;s a good fit, AFAIK there is work to productize this).<p>The wide perception that JIT-compiled code has to be slower stems from <i>other</i> sources of performance overhead that are typical to languages which happen to use JIT (many of which have &quot;weaker&quot; compilers too), not from the JIT compilation itself. There <i>are</i> technicalities like certain calls have to be indirect in order to support patching the callee address, or inter-procedural analysis which is trivial to prove under AOT may not be so under JIT where new callers&#x2F;callees may be constructed dynamically or a reJIT invoked which would invalidate the analysis results. JIT also costs additional memory. But it&#x27;s not a source of worse performance.",

Junie is a great AI coding assistant, seems to be on par with Claude Code (and can use Anthropic models e.g. Claude Sonnet, or other models).<p>Also, Claude Desktop can be configured to serve Jetbrains MCP Server, which will let Claude Desktop (or any other coding AI&#x2F;LLM) connect and control Jetbrains IDEs, including changing project configuration, listing &#x2F; finding files, editing files, looking at VCS diffs.<p>So I believe Jetbrains is addressing the AI coding assistant market, they&#x27;re not making as much noise and perhaps they should be ... feature-wise I think Jetbrains IDEs + AI integrations will be as good, in the long term, as other systems. At least I hope so, because I can&#x27;t let go of PyCharm, Webstorm, IntelliJ IDEA, Goland, et al",

(It was existence proof that you could build excellent UIs in Java.) Unlike Eclipse, and other forgotten IDEs that were so bad I discarded them immediately. Even early on, their refactorings were usually flawless. While I think I found one screwup, they were so good that they changed the way I coded. I could easily and reliably do refactorings that were otherwise pretty time-consuming and error-prone. I have continued using their products: mostly PyCharm now, and occasionally CLion.<p>Each new release improves the UI, and occasionally adds features that I find useful, and many that I don&#x27;t.  I suspect that I&#x27;m not alone in using a very tiny portion of the features they offer. How they can keep up with all the languages, and libraries, and frameworks is beyond me, but they seem to do it.<p>Their support has always been excellent. I once (v4?) complained that refactorings did not extend into configurations. E.g., if I rename a class Foo to Bar, then the runtime configuration running Foo didn&#x27;t reflect the change. I reported it, and found a fix in the next release. Email with technical questions or bug reports is always handled promptly and thoughtfully.<p>They have always provided absolutely fantastic products for free. Yes, you gave up some features, but the free versions are really useful. I&#x27;m retired now, but continue to pay their licensing fees every year, for my hobby usage, because it&#x27;s worth it, and they earn it. And the licensing is not onerous to use. What I really like is that you don&#x27;t have to be on the internet to use their products, just for the license check. I wish all licensed products did that.<p>And beyond all this: <i>They haven&#x27;t sold out.</i> They are one of the very, very few for-profit tech companies that have maintained a stellar level of product breadth, depth, quality, and support for such a long period of time. I&#x27;m sure they could have cashed in, sold to IBM and the product would have just rotted away, (sorry, IBM, but you know it&#x27;s true). I can only think of one product that is comparable in this way, and that&#x27;s Postgres.<p>Thank you, JetBrains, you have Figured It Out.",

One thing I dislike with these IDEs is that they do a lot in the background that feels like is outside of my control. I can&#x27;t really point my finger exactly to where this feeling is coming from but I only get that impression when I use these heavy IDEs.<p>Say I want my development environment &#x2F; settings &#x2F; workspace config to be easily replicated and configured when someone new joins the project, will their Jetbrains IDE recognize it and prompt the user to adapt? Because that is one thing I enjoy with vscode, EVERYTHING is under my control and I can see what everything does. The buttons that runs different tasks can easily be viewed on .vscode&#x2F;tasks.json, all config is within the .vscode folder!<p>In Jetbrains IDEs, some things are local only and you have to ask the peers to screenshare which config they had. I don&#x27;t want that, I want the whole workspace to be easily replicated and shared.<p>I know Jetbrains is working on Fleet, I&#x27;ve been trying it out a couple of times and I like it, I hope they take this into their consideration.",

This seems like a subtle distinction, but I think it&#x27;s an important one in the world of subscription services.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sales.jetbrains.com&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-gb&#x2F;articles&#x2F;207240845-What-is-a-perpetual-fallback-license\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sales.jetbrains.com&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-gb&#x2F;articles&#x2F;207240845-What...</a>",

Reason, Java has several decent OSS IDEs as an alternative and those would win by default if the only option was a paid IDE. Clion and Rustover are somewhere in between I suspect.<p>VS Code plugins vary from language to language. And commercial non OSS tools for native development are pretty common (e.g. Visual Studio, XCode, etc.). So, I guess Jetbrains feels more comfortable charging for Clion and Rustover for commercial development because they know they are that good. But nothing wrong if you don&#x27;t appreciate what is on offer.<p>Yes these tools use some memory and CPU. But then I use a decent laptop as well so it doesn&#x27;t matter to me.
