        "text": "I love GrapheneOS. The biggest downside is that Google integrity API block wireless payments in Google Pay. All Dutch banks now advertise to install Google pay for wireless payments.\nI&#x27;ve tried asking Google to support GrapheneOS but they told me to do a feature request. Which I did and got no reply to. I&#x27;ve contacted the consumer market authority and made a formal complaint since Google and Apple share effectively a contactless payments duopoly and decide which OS distributions get access. Those are closed source and usually bundled with a lot of spyware. I also explained how the Google integrity API might affect banking availability in the future (and already does for some banking apps). They took it very seriously and I hope to hear from them in the future.",

File management and getting files into apps is the #1 area where Android wins.<p>For example, iOS has me copying or saving audiobooks into a folder only to import them into BookPlayer, whereas Android’s Smart Audiobook Player lets me copy my book to my audiobooks folder and hit ‘rescan’.<p>Funnily enough, one of the only music apps on iOS that offers the same functionality - copy a folder into your library and rescan - is the same Neutron Player I used to use on Android. The interface is clunky, but that’s a small price to pay.",
